"Joan Silk";"Building Strong Bonds in Baboons: Patterns, Mechanisms, and Adaptive Outcomes     (#1)";"Sociality has evolved in many animal taxa, and presumably reflects a balance between the benefits of living in groups (such as lower risk of predation) and costs (higher rates of competition over resources).  Selection is expected to favor traits that enable individuals to increase the benefit/cost ratio. The formation of close social bonds among female baboons may be favored as a means of increasing b/c ratios. In some primate species, strong affiliative ties are linked to coalitionary success and the ability to acquire high ranking positions in the dominance hierarchy.  Data from two different long-term studies of baboons show that females form strong, equitable, supportive, tolerant, and stable social relationships with selected partners, particularly close maternal kin and peers. Close social bonds help female baboons to cope with various sources of stress. In addition, females with close social bonds have higher survival among their offspring and live longer than other females.  These findings suggest that close social bonds may provide a means for females to increase the b/c ratio of group life. However, to form these bonds, females must overcome barriers that keep them apart---the risk of conflict. Work on baboons suggests that they use grunts to communicate peaceful intentions. Grunts facilitate proximity and affiliation, reconcile aggressive conflicts, and relieve anxiety. Thus, these signals may provide an important link between the benefits of social bonds and the risks inherent in interacting with potential competitors.   ";"School of Human Evolution and Social Change, Arizona State University, Tempe"

The grunt call is one of the\nmost frequent vocalizations in their vocal repertoire, and may play a role in the\nspecies’ social structure organization. We investigated the presence of vocal\nsignature in grunt calls and its relationship with dominance ranking of 19 captive\npeccaries (9 males and 10 females). We collected 4,021 grunt calls and selected\n1,849 with the best quality and least noise interference. From these we randomly\nchose 50 calls from each individual for DFA analysis. The acoustic parameters\nused were harmonic-to-noise ratio or HNR (dB), frequency interval (Hz), maximum\nfrequency, dominant frequency (Hz) and element duration (s). The dominant male was\nthe only animal that did not emit grunt calls. Considering all five\nacoustic parameters we could discriminate among the grunt calls of the 18\nanimals (Wilks Lambda = 0.55, P < 0.0001, N=900; cross validation:\n19%, p< 0.05). The correct attribution to individuals' calls varied\nas a function of their dominance status (rs = -0.48, N=18, P < 0.05). We also observed that the\nmore subordinate the individuals are, the more grunt calls they emit (rs= 0.54; n=19, P=0.008). The duration and HNH parameters provide\ndifferences between males’ and females’ grunt calls (F(2,15)= 3.21, P<0.05).\nOur study revealed that grunt calls provide information on animal identity, social\nstatus and sex, which is adaptive to maintain the cohesion of white-lipped\npeccaries that are used to living in herds comprising more than 100 individuals.";"Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz, Ilheus, BAHIA, Brazil"

Close calls are individual-specific,\nbut the degree of individual flexibility in call production remains unclear. Given\ntheir importance in mediating interactions during foraging, we predicted that\nclose call structure might reflect the transient nature of encounters between\nsubordinate females of different ranks.

Previous studies have shown that when\nwild mothers and calves are caught and temporarily separated, each makes its\nown signature whistle repeatedly, but occasionally copies the other's whistle\nas well (King et al., 2013; Sayigh et al., 1990).

However,\nthere has been very little research on the vocal mechanisms a female dolphin may\nemploy when she wants to reunite with her calf. In this study, we\nrepeatedly asked an adult female dolphin to Go get (i.e., retrieve) her\n3-month-old calf or Go get another object, while we recorded her vocal\nbehaviour.  The vocal response to the two\ntrial types was significantly different (GLM, P = 0.0003).

Research on domestic pig vocalizations, for example, has led to significant advances in our understanding of communicative function. Despite the close relation to domestic pigs, very little is known about wild boar (Sus scrofa) vocalizations. The few existing studies on this social species, conducted in the 1970âs, relied on visual inspections of spectrograms to quantify acoustic parameters and lacked statistical analysis. Here, we use objective signal processing techniques and advanced statistical approaches to classify 617 calls recorded from semi-free ranging animals. Based on four spectral and temporal acoustic parameters âquartile Q25, spectral flux, spectral flatness and durationâ extracted from a multivariate analysis, we refine and extend the conclusions drawn from previous work and present a statistically validated classification of the wild boar vocal repertoire into four call types: grunts, grunt-squeals, squeals and trumpets. While the majority of calls could be sorted into these categories using objective criteria, we also found evidence supporting a graded interpretation of wild boar vocal communication as acoustically continuous, with the extremes representing discrete call types. Integrating our findings with recent studies on domestic pig vocal behaviour and emotions, we highlight the potential importance of grunt-squeals for acoustic approaches to animal welfare.

Foragers exposed to playback of the Watchman’s song (low\namplitude calls given by sentinels on guard duty) in traffic noise were more\nvigilant than during ambient noise. However, the pattern of lower vigilance in\nthe presence of a dominant sentinel compared to a subordinate was retained\nduring traffic noise playback, indicating that cues to caller identity were\nstill available. Moreover, an additional experiment found that exposure to playback\nof traffic noise alone (with no mongoose vocalisations\nthat could be masked) caused foragers to increase vigilance. Our results\ndemonstrate that anthropogenic noise can impact responses to key anti-predator\nvocalisations and that disruption of vocal communication may not be explained solely\nby masking.

Both\ntreefrog species showed similar patterns of microhabitat use in their diel\ncycle and occurred in all five microhabitats: rice paddy, ground, buried,\ngrass, and bush.

Although mate choice based on wing colouration has been documented in butterflies, empirical evidence remains scant and is limited to a handful of species. Furthermore, male and female mate choice have rarely been studied in the same species, although both are known to occur in butterflies. In this study, behavioural experiments were conducted to investigate female and male mate choice in the Common Mormon Papilio polytes, a swallowtail butterfly which exhibits female-limited mimetic polymorphism. By artificially reducing male dorsal brightness, we found that mimetic and non-mimetic females did not prefer to mate with brighter males, whereas male size seemed to influence female mate choice. As there was a positive correlation between male size and brightness, female preference for larger males might lead to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in dorsal brightness. In the second part of this study, we offered male butterflies a choice of mimetic and non-mimetic females, and found that males mated preferentially with the mimetic female form. The hypothesis that male mate choice is involved in the persistence of the non-mimetic female form was therefore not supported. Future studies could investigate the role of female mate choice in the evolution of female-limited mimicry, as well as potential factors (e.g. female pheromones) that affect male mate choice.";"National University of Singapore, Singapore"

"Robert J Dugand";"Indirect genetic benefits and the maintenance of genetic variation in male mating success.     (#20)";"The lek paradox – that persistent female choice for genetic benefits should preclude choice from resulting in genetic benefits – has long intrigued evolutionary biologists. The constant influx and transient persistence of new mutations into populations could help in resolving the lek paradox by explaining the maintenance of genetic variation in traits affecting male mating success, particularly if these traits are represented by many loci. This would be true if mating success was genetically correlated with condition, a trait which is expected to be affected by many genes and hence thousands of loci. Such condition-dependent mating success would lead to the expectation that variation in mating success was due to differences in the mutational load among males and, consequently, that mating success itself should be susceptible to inbreeding depression and display positive pleiotropy with other life-history traits which are also condition-dependent (i.e. ‘good genes’ benefits). Here, we test these predictions by applying divergent selection on male mating success for 14 generations in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster and then quantify key components of fitness for both outbred and inbred individuals. Males from success-selected lines had 17.9% greater mating success than males from failure-selected lines. Overall, mating success was prone to inbreeding depression, with outbred individuals recording 9.7% more matings than inbred individuals, indicating that mutational load affects mating success and therefore mating success is genotypically condition-dependent. There was no significant interaction between cross type (inbred or outbred) and selection regime (i.e. no difference in mutational load between selection reigmes). Additionally, egg-to-adult viability was not prone to inbreeding depression and was not different across selection regimes. Our results indicate that, while females enjoy the indirect genetic benefit of improved male mating success of their sons (i.e ‘sexy sons’), overall we found no evidence for good genes benefits gained through precopulatory sexual selection.";"The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia"

Finally, given the effects of sensory experience, I examined the\neffects of perceived availability and quality\non adult vibratory preferences when females were only able to experience\nvibratory playback of male courtship signals as juveniles. Taken together,\nthese experiments highlight that adult mating decisions are impacted social\nconditions.

"Lisa Locatello";"Context-dependent female preference in a fish     (#22)";"Female choice is often assumed to be based on absolute\npreference, driven by a threshold value of male attractiveness. However,\nincreasing evidence suggests that females may instead perform a comparative\nevaluation of prospective mates, possibly incurring in violation of rational\ndecision rules. A prototypical case is the 'asymmetrically dominated decoy'\neffect where the preference for a target option over a competitor is altered by\nthe addition of an irrelevant alternative. We tested for this effect in the\npeacock blenny Salaria pavo. Females,\nfaced with two focal options, differing in body size and extension of a yellow\nspot, strongly preferred one of the options. The addition of a decoy,\nexhibiting a lower expression than both focal options on one trait, but lying\nbetween them on the other trait, shifted female preference according to the\ninitially preferred trait and to the decoy type. Indeed, females modified their\npreference in presence of the decoy with the intermediate expression of the\ntrait less preferred initially, whereas they did not when the decoy for the\npreferred trait was added. Thus, females’ evaluation resulted to be\ncontext-dependent, even if the violation of rational decision rules occurred\nonly with respect to the initially less preferred trait. This does not exclude\nthat females are in any case using comparative decision rules. When faced with\nthree alternatives they might not be able to discriminate among them, perceiving\nstimulus absolute magnitude.";"Department of Biology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"

For example, the New Zealand huntaway, a farm working breed, is reported to be less sensitive to pain than other breeds, i.e. they are believed to have a high pain threshold. This, however, has never been scientifically tested. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in thermal nociceptive thresholds among dog breeds. Three New Zealand working/sport dog breeds (harrier hounds, greyhounds, huntaways, n=10 per breed) were used. To test thermal pain sensitivity, a progressively increasing heat stimulus was applied to the leg of each unrestrained dog using a remotely activated device, and the time and temperature at which the dog responded behaviourally was recorded. Each dog was tested 6 times in a one-hour session once a week for four consecutive weeks. Response time and temperature were analysed using a linear mixed model including fixed effects of device, breed, week, test and their interactions and dog as a random effect. A breed effect was found for latency to respond (raw mean ± SE (s): harriers 33.3 ± 0.9; greyhounds 34.6 ± 1.0; huntaways 36.4 ± 0.9; P = 0.003) and response temperature (harriers 49.0 ± 0.4 ºC; greyhounds 48.7 ± 0.4; huntaways 50.0 ± 0.4; P = 0.011). Huntaways took significantly longer to respond to the thermal stimulus than did greyhounds (P = 0.057) and harrier hounds (P = 0.0006) and responded at higher temperatures than the other breeds (greyhounds P = 0.0201; harrier hounds P = 0.0045). There were no differences in latency or response temperature between greyhounds and harriers.

I measured locomotor performance of adult females at\nfour different temperatures (20°, 25°, 30° and 35°C) during the day and at\nnight.

We investigated patterns of female coalition formation and\nsocial bonds in a group of wild bonobos at Wamba, Luo Scientific Reserve, DR\nCongo. We recorded all aggressive interactions during party follows. Coalition\nwas defined as simultaneous aggression directed by two or more individuals\nagainst a common target.

"Timon van Asten";"Coping style and brood care in cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens     (#32)";"Little is known\nabout how animal personality affects social interactions and what the fitness\nconsequences are. This is especially relevant in highly social species like\ncooperative breeders, where individuals interact frequently, often with close\nrelatives. Under such circumstances reducing conflict and competition can\nincrease fitness. This can be achieved through social niche specialisation,\nwhere individuals perform specific functions within their social unit, likely\nrelated to individual personality traits. To test this we related individual exploration\nscores obtained from a novel environment test (a measure of coping with stress)\nto brood care behaviour in a wild population of superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus). Exploration scores of\nbreeders and helpers were compared to nestling provisioning rates and nest\ndefence from a conspecific ‘intruder’ (taxidermic mount). To test for broader\nniche specialisation, individuals’ feeding rates and nest defence were also\ncompared. Females provisioned nestlings at a relatively higher rate than males,\nbut provisioning was not related to exploration score in general or within role\n(breeder/helper) or sexes. During nest defence, birds approached the ‘intruder’\nsignificantly closer and stayed near it for longer when other group members\nwere present. Males in groups with helpers showed a positive relationship\nbetween time spent near the model and exploration score, whereas females in\nthose groups and breeders without helpers showed no such relationship. Finally,\nrelative feeding rate was not related to nest defence intensity. Thus, group living may provide\nfitness benefits in two ways: (i) the presence of group members stimulates nest\ndefence, (ii) personality variation can promote social niche specialisation:\nwhile more exploratory birds defend, less exploratory birds can keep feeding.\nThis may lead to reduced disturbance at the nest and a more constant feeding\nrate, benefiting nestling development.";"School of Biosciences, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia"

Until now, most research on cooperative breeding has\nfocused on the group level, despite the fact that many cooperatively breeding\nspecies exhibit multi-level sociality. Here we show that different levels of\nsociality may simultaneously and interactively influence Darwinian fitness of\nhelpers and breeders. The social structure of the cooperatively breeding\ncichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher comprises\ntwo distinct levels: individuals form groups and groups cluster in colonies.\nOur long-term field data show that larger groups enjoy higher survival and\nproductivity. Groups located at higher densities also benefit from better\nsurvival chances, but productivity is interactively influenced by density:\nlarger groups benefit from low densities, while small groups are more\nproductive at higher densities. This outcome is likely caused by effects of competition\nand cooperation between groups. At high densities, groups frequently engage in\nterritorial conflicts, but our additional experiments show that they can also benefit\nfrom the anti-predator behaviour of neighbouring groups. For small groups, the\nbenefits of between-group cooperation appear to outweigh the costs of\nbetween-group conflict, whereas this does not apply to large groups. Our\nresults highlight that the exclusive focus on within-group cooperation in the\nstudy of highly social animals may limit the understanding of the evolutionary\nmechanisms underlying cooperation and altruism, because the costs and benefits of\nsociality may greatly vary between different levels of social organisation.";"University of Bern, Hinterkappelen, BERN, Switzerland"
"Shona Duguid";"A comparison of how children and chimpanzees coordinate decisions for mutual benefit     (#34)";"One of the challenges of cooperation is to coordinate with others. This is a challenge faced by both humans (Homo sapiens) and their closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Both species coordinate their actions in a variety of contexts including group hunting, territory defence, and deciding direction of travel. However the cognitive mechanisms leading to successful coordination are not necessarily the same. Recently, theoretical accounts have proposed that humans have evolved unique skills for coordinating decisions and actions with others in the pursuit of common interests. We tested this hypothesis using a comparative approach by presenting pairs of 4 year old children and pairs of chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, with a very simple coordination problem. To succeed both individuals were required to choose the same one of four options. If successful they each received the same reward, so there were no conflicts of interest. Furthermore, the rewards associated with each option were identical, thus preferences for a particular option could not play a role. To investigate the flexibility of coordination we paired each individual with multiple partners. Our results showed that both species were able to achieve successful coordination, but there were marked differences in the way they did so. Children, using either communication or a leader-follower strategy, were able to coordinate quickly and flexibly, adjusting easily to new partners. In contrast, chimpanzees took time to converge on a single solution and started over from zero with each new partner, suggesting a lack of understanding of the process of coordination. Together, these results provide evidence for a divergence in the coordination skills of these two species and therefore the cognitive mechanisms underlying cooperation.";"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, SACHSEN, Germany"

"John C Wingfield";"Modulation of the adrenocortical response to acute perturbations.     (#45)";"Perturbations of the\nenvironment result in activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis\n(HPA) and an increase in glucocorticoid secretion that triggers the emergency\nlife history stage (EHLS). This stage regulates behavioural and physiological\nresponses that promote self preservation at the expense of regular life history\nstages such as breeding. This adrenocortical response to perturbations is found\nfrom fish to humans. Field and laboratory evidence indicates that the\nadrenocortical response to perturbations can be modulated according to season,\nlife history stage and sex in many vertebrates. In the Gambel’s white-crowned\nsparrow the adrenocortical responses to a standardized experimental\nperturbation (capture, handling and restraint), are up-regulated at, and soon\nafter, arrival on the breeding grounds in males, but much less so in females.\nOnce nesting is initiated, the adrenocortical responses are down-regulated in\nboth sexes. The increased activity of the HPA axis at arrival provides behavioural\nand physiological flexibility at a time of extreme weather conditions, but once\nnesting is initiated then responses of the HPA axis to perturbations are\nsuppressed to maximize reproductive success. Experimental evidence reveals that\nthe sensitivity to negative feedback of corticosterone is decreased at arrival\nin males but not females. Furthermore, plasma levels of corticosterone-binding\nglobulin also increase at this time perhaps providing a buffer to protect against\nhigh corticosteroid levels. Modulation of the HPA axis appears to be at the\nhypothalamic level or higher accompanied by changes in mineralocorticoid\nreceptor gene expression in the hypothalamus. Modulation of the HPA axis and\nthe response to perturbations may be critical to maximize flexibility and self\npreservation before nesting begins, but then are down-regulated to enhance\nreproductive success.";"University of California, Davis, CA, United States"

However, in contrast to\nthe zebra finch, the less gregarious Angolan blue waxbill (Estrildidae: Uraeginthus angolensis) exhibits fewer\nVT-immunoreactive cells in the BSTm as well as differences in receptor\ndistribution across the LS subnuclei, suggesting that knockdown of VT\nproduction in the BSTm would produce behavioral effects in Angolan blue\nwaxbills that are distinct from zebra finches. Thus, we quantified social\ncontact, gregariousness (i.e. preference for the larger of two groups), and\nanxiety-like behavior following bilateral antisense knockdown of VT production\nin the BSTm of male and female Angolan blue waxbills. We found that BSTm VT\nneurons promote social contact, but not gregariousness (as in male zebra\nfinches), and that antisense effects on social contact are significantly\nstronger in male waxbills than in females. Knockdown of BSTm VT production has\nno effect on anxiety-like behavior.

Long-term memories last hours to weeks, whereas\nmemories that persist for months to years are known as long-lasting memories.\nDespite considerable knowledge of the effects of GCs on short- and long-term\nmemory, understanding of the effects of GCs on long-lasting memory is\nessentially nonexistent. The goal of this study was to understand the effects\nof GCs on the acquisition and retention of long-lasting memory. We asked: do circulating glucocorticoids affect the\nlong-lasting memory of an emotionally arousing event? We exposed free-living\nFlorida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma\ncoerulescens; FSJs) to a modified\nfear conditioning protocol that used a novel ‘predator’ as the conditioned\nstimulus. Endogenous and manipulated levels of corticosterone (CORT; the\nprimary avian GC) immediately after conditioning were compared to the FSJs’\nlong-lasting response to the novel ‘predator’ using flight initiation distance\n(FID). Our results indicate that CORT has an inverted U-shaped relationship\nwith the retention of long-lasting memory with low and high levels impairing memory\nformation or retention. Additionally, FSJs with a moderate stress-response phenotype\ndisplay an intensified conditioned response with time (i.e., FID increases over\ntime), superficially similar to sensitization, but occurring after associative\nlearning in the absence of reinforcement and over a much longer time frame.

For residents this period includes two life history stages -\nwinter and breeding - while migrants express 4 including winter, prealternate moult,\nvernal migration and development of the breeding stage. Thus the migrant is characterized\nas having a higher finite state diversity (FSD) in comparison with the resident\n(Wingfield 2008; Ramenofsky and Wingfield 2007). Because each life history\nstage requires time to develop, be expressed and then be terminated (at least a\nmonth), then high FSD predicts less flexibility in terms of timing onset of the\nspring events. The study was conducted from December to May and included 11\nresident and 12 migrant males held in individual registration cages under local\nphotoperiod. Development of the breeding stage for residents was detected in January\nwith levels of 5a-dihydrotestosterone and testosterone peaking\nin early March along with lengthening of the cloacal protuberance.

One currently nesting\nwild-caught male and 2 birds from the hand-reared group reacted with a loud\nnoisy call (probably a distress call) to predator. Similar reactions were noticed\nin the context of strange terrifying object and in the presence of the strange\nhuman. In the context of food, members of the hand-reared group emitted\nspecific vocalizations (high frequency peeps). In the context of social\nisolation, a variety of calls were emitted by the hand-reared parrots, but\ntonal calls were more present than in neutral context. Also these context\nspecific calls differ from the one determined by Giret et al.

Here, we use the state-of-the-art materials science technique, synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [1], and scanning electron microscopy to interrogate the development of the amorphous, nanoporous morphology in medullary barb cells of growing feather germs (pin feathers) of nestling Blue Tits ( Cyanistes caeruleus  , Paridae). We show that the intracellular self-assembly of the barb nanostructure is consistent with a visco-elastic model of phase separation of polymerising beta-keratin from the cellular cytoplasm, given the lack of self-similarity along the proximal to distal axis of barb maturation. In addition, we document a wavefront-like progression of phase separation in the feather barb cells from the proximal base to the more mature distal tip of the feather. The final arrested nanostructure in mature barb cells is characterised by a slight increase in the peak spatial frequency likely due to volume shrinkage, suggesting that desiccation, a fundamental feature of apoptosing feather cells, plays an important role in the determination of the dominant length scale of the nanostructure.

However, recent reports of considerable inter-site\nvariability of chimpanzee behaviour challenge this dichotomy. Since direct\ncomparisons of communicative abilities are still lacking, the present study aimed\nto examine whether bonobos and chimpanzees use similar or different communicative\nstrategies. To do so, we focused on one communicative function, the initiation\nof carries for joint travel, and recorded the communicative behaviour of 25 mother-infant\ndyads in two bonobo (LuiKotal, Wamba; DRC) and two chimpanzee\ncommunities (Taï South, Côte d’Ivoire;\nKanyawara, Uganda) in the wild (total\nhours of observation for chimpanzees: 1200; bonobos: 800 hours). We had the\nfollowing question: Does species affiliation influence the variability and structure\nof signal production in mother-infant dyads? To answer this question, we focused\non actions, gestures and multi-modal signals used to initiate joint travel, as\nwell as 'signal-response' structures (e.g. occurrence of response waiting, gestural\nsequences and coordinated responses) while taking into account dyadic role and\ninfant age. The analysis of a total of 735 leaving interactions showed that\ncommunicative interactions of bonobos and chimpanzees differed in relation to\nboth role and infant age. Specifically, chimpanzees showed a higher frequency\nof carries that were initiated by gestures, response waiting, sequences and\nhence, more communicative persistence.

Classification errors almost always lead to loss of fitness: incorrect classification of another animal as a competitor may lead to costly agonistic behaviour, and the incorrect classification of a predator may lead to death. We studied classification of faces in a species of coral reef fish, P. amboinensis, which has individually distinct facial patterns, using a combination of behaviour and machine vision techniques. A series of experiments relying on associative learning was conducted to test the facial discrimination ability of the fish both within and between species. Fish received a food reward when they successfully selected their trained stimulus (face discrimination), or a certain stimulus class (conspecific / heterospecific face). Stimuli consisted of greyscale images of the head with facial markings or of the extracted patterns alone and, depending on the experiment, were either laminated printouts or presented on a computer screen.We found that the fish quickly learn to discriminate between two facial patterns stemming from either conspecific or heterospecific fish and that they are highly sensitive to slight pattern differences such as are found on individual conspecifics, or artificially induced differences by morphing between pairs of faces. We also found that following initial training with four pairs of conspecific / heterospecific faces, the fish were able to classify novel conspecific and heterospecific faces with 75% accuracy. Evidence for categorical perception was found when morphed facial patterns were used.Our results show that face discrimination in fish has many similarities with what we know about human face discrimination, despite their lack of a neocortex.

"Anuradhi Jayaweera";"The effect of female quality on male ejaculatory expenditure and reproductive success in a praying mantid     (#68)";"Strategic ejaculation is a\nbehavioural strategy shown by many animals as a response to sperm competition\nand/or as a potential mechanism of cryptic male choice. Males invest more\nmating resources when the risk of sperm competition increases or they invest\nmore in high quality females to maximize their reproductive output. We tested\nthis hypothesis in the false garden mantid Pseudomantis\nalbofimbriata, where females are capable of multiply mating and body\ncondition is an indicator of potential reproductive fitness. We predicted male\nmantidswould ejaculate strategically\nby allocating more sperm to high quality females. To determine if and how males\nalter their ejaculate in response to mate quality, we manipulated female food\nquantity so that females were either in good condition with many eggs (i.e.\nhigh quality) or poor condition with few eggs (i.e. low quality). Half of the\nfemales from each treatment were used in mating trials in which transferred\nsperm was counted before fertilisation occurred and the other half of females\nwere used in mating trials where fertilisation occurred and ootheca mass and\ntotal eggs in the ootheca were recorded. Opposed to our predictions, the total\nnumber of sperm and the proportion of viable sperm transferred did not vary\nsignificantly between female treatments. Male reproductive success was entirely\ndependent on female quality/fecundity, rather than on the number of sperm\ntransferred. These results suggest that female quality is not a major factor\ninfluencing postcopulatory male mating strategies in P. albofimbriata, and that sperm number has little effect on male\nreproductive success in a single mating scenario. ";"Macquarie University, Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

A wide range of animal taxa that\ndisplay sexual size dimorphism exhibit an allometric relationship in which the\ndegree of sexual dimorphism increases with body size, a pattern known as\nRensch’s rule. Here, we investigated variation in wing pigmentation and body\nsize in 640 populations of 83 species of New World libellulid dragonflies\n(Anisoptera, Libellulidae). First, we found that sexual dichromatism in wing\npigmentation was consistent with Rensch’s rule, as the major axis regression\nslope was significantly greater than one (β = 1.756, 95% CI: 1.469 to 2.138, n\n= 69). Second, we show that sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in dragonflies is not\ndifferent from unit, and there is little evidence of Rensch’s rule in SSD in\nthe group, as this relationship is isometric. Taken together, our results\nprovide evidence, for the first time, that a trait other than body size\nexhibits a pattern consistent with Rensch’s rule. These findings suggest that\nwing pigmentation is possibly under sex-specific or sexually antagonistic\nselection in species with marked male-biased sexual dichromatism. ";"LAGE do Departamento de Ecologia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil"

Because such passive\nfactors restrict the possibility set of potential partners, they may either\nrestrict the chance of fulfilling mating preferences or lead to a high level of\npositive assortative mating.  The\npossibility set may be further reduced by competition in the mating market. It\nis also unclear from couple’s data how much assortative mating is driven by\npartner selection to reduce anticipated child rearing problem and how much by a\ndesire for parental assistance and altruistic preferences for offspring. Adopting the online market for sperm donation as the research setting\nreduces such problems: the more controlled setting ensures isolation of a\nmale’s genetic impact on his offspring from other factors. By identifying the factors that influence the symmetry of\ncharacteristics between recipients and partners and recipients and donors chosen,\nwe provide empirical evidence that even with limited constraints on available\nchoice, women still exhibit homogamous donor preferences. Likewise,\nby exploring how potential donors’ characteristics match partner\ncharacteristics, we offer insights into what drives recipients’ desires to find\ndonors who surpass both their own and their partners’ characteristics.";"Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QUEEN, Australia"

Groups of 18 players\nplay 3 consecutive independent games of 10 rounds each. They are subdivided in\n6 groups, “countries”, of 3 players each.

Here, we show that exposure to elevated temperatures significantly\naffected the predator–prey interactions of a pair of common reef fish, the planktivorous damselfish (Pomacentrus wardi) and the\npiscivorous dottyback (Pseudochromis fuscus). When predators exposed to elevated temperatures interacted with prey exposed\nin a similar manner, maximal attack speeds increased. This effect coupled with decreasing prey escape speeds and escape distances led to increased predation rates. Prey exposed to elevated temperatures also had decreased reaction distances and\nincreased apparent looming threshold, suggesting that their sensory performance was affected. This occurred despite the\nincrease in maximal attack speeds, which in other species has been shown to increase reaction distances. These results suggest\nthat the escape performance of prey is sensitive to short-term increases in ambient temperature. As marine environments\nbecome more thermally variable in the future, our results demonstrate that some predators may become more successful, suggesting that there will be strong selection for the maintenance of maximal escape performance in prey.

An ongoing experiment, involving the removal of cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus from seven reefs and left undisturbed on nine reefs (64-285 m2) for 15 years, has shown 1) decreases in the abundance and diversity of large visiting and small resident fishes, and abundance of recruited residents, juvenile visitors, and juvenile conspecifics; 2) a decrease in growth and increase in parasitic copepods in individuals of a resident species; and 3) a skew in the size frequency distribution of individuals towards more small fish in two resident species. However, the mechanisms involved in these community-wide and individual effects remain unclear. Cleaner wrasse eat parasitic gnathiid isopods: ~1200 day-1 individual-1. An increase in these harmful blood-feeders could explain the observed effects on fish. Therefore, we tested whether their infection rate differed with cleaner presence. As clients, we used a resident (ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis) and a visitor (thick-lipped wrasse, Hemigymnus melapterus). On the experimental reefs, fish were placed in traps (~12h, day/night) which gnathiids could enter but not escape. Few gnathiids (0-3) infected damselfish, with more at night; and they were not affected by cleaner presence. In contrast, more gnathiids infected wrasse; with more on cleaner-absent (0-179) than on cleaner-present (0-14) reefs in the day; at night there was no difference between reefs without (0-25) and with (0-24) cleaners. This is the first demonstration that cleaner wrasse affect the infection rate of gnathiids.

However, to truly test the hypothesis it is\nparamount to also look at different animal orders and classes. Cooperative breeding is common in birds, with\na particularly high incidence in corvids (41% of all corvid species show some\ndegree of allo-parental care), which makes them the optimal target for\ninvestigating the cooperative breeding hypothesis in a group that is phylogenetically\ndistant from primates. Therefore, here we investigated two closely related\ncorvid species – ravens (Corvus corax,\nN=10) and crows (C. corone and cornix, N=9) – whose social systems\ndiffer in their extent of allo-parenting. While cooperative breeding is\nextremely rare in ravens, at least one population of crows shows extensive\nallo-parenting – a behavioural strategy that can also be induced in individuals\ntransferred from different populations. In the current study both species were\nkept under identical conditions and subjected to regular behavioural\nobservations and experiments over the course of more than two years.

Further,\nmanipulation of the same object by two or more birds at the same time was\nobserved more frequently in crows than in ravens. Unlike crows however, ravens\nwere tolerant towards specific individuals in their group from an early age on.\nThese preliminary findings support the cooperative breeding hypothesis, but\nthere additionally seems to be an effect of social bonding, which needs to be\ninvestigated – optimally in a larger set of species.

Individuals that were  in groups had different movement profiles\ncompared to lone individuals; they were less saltatory, generally more active,\nand spent more time in open water away from cover.

These behaviours may operate over very different time scales, from tens to thousands of milliseconds. Observation and characterisation of these behaviors is technically difficult based on these short timescales, and methodologically challenging because of the behavioural variability involved.  Widefield stabilisation is a robust visuomotor behaviour essential to maintain stable flight in response to environmental disturbances. Most of the current understanding of this behaviour comes from tethered experiments, where the subject is rigidly restrained and the normal sensorimotor experience disrupted. We have created a novel virtual reality system and an experimental paradigm that allows studying this behaviour in freely moving subjects, in a naturalistic environment. While in free flight we actively manipulate the subject by systematically eliciting the optomotor response. Continued elicitation of this behaviour allows us to control the position of the fly in 3D. To probe the behaviour in greater detail we can also perturb the fly or show challenging visual stimulus. Using control theoretic methods taken from the engineering fields we can build behavioural models for individual flies and individual trials. Using this paradigm, and in combination with the powerful genetic tools available for Drosophila, we are uncovering the frequency and temporal characteristics, and the role of certain neurons in the optomotor response in free flight. From the success of these experiments we are also investigating other visuomotor behaviours, using a similar virtual reality assay, in freefly swimming zebrafish.";"Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Vienna, VIENNA, Austria"

After an\nacclimation period and determination of social structure, two juvenile lemon\nsharks (Negaprion brevirostris) were added to the wetland area to\nexamine the effects of potential predators on interaction patterns, habitat use\nand general activity of the bonefish. Following this second component, sharks\nwere removed, and social network structure was again measured to determine if\npreviously observed network dynamics returned to original patterns. Following\nobservations, all bonefish were placed in respirometers to ascertain individual\ndifferences in metabolic rate. All bonefish\nand sharks were captured simultaneously at a single site to minimize holding effects and\ninsure all individuals had the same experience in terms of capture and previous\nexposure to sharks. Each bonefish was outfitted with individually identifiable\ntri-axial accelerometer loggers and allowed to move freely throughout the\nentire system for a period of 7 days. \nUsing a recently developed Markov chain model, we quantified the network\ndynamics of the test population, including consistency of individual network\npositions across observations and compared that to other metrics of behaviour. We\nfound strong correlations between individual network characteristics, movement\npatterns, metabolic rate and estimates of behavioural type within treatments. However\nthe presence of sharks was disruptive to all aspects of behaviour studied\n(networks, activity, habitat use). This disruption appeared to have a lasting\neffect, as the differences in behaviour continued throughout the third\ntreatment following shark removal.

"Creagh Breuner";"The migration-breeding transition: integrating behavior, stress physiology and fitness from a long term data set     (#92)";"The transition from migration to breeding requires major changes in physiology and behavior. Many long-distance migrants need to be highly flexible during this transition, given the disconnect between conditions on the wintering grounds and at the breeding site.  Arrival at the breeding site may be followed by immediate initiation of nesting (in mild years), or an extended wait for nest sites to become available (in more extreme years). The mountain white-crowned sparrow faces highly variable conditions on arrival at the breeding site: nest initiation dates varied by 6 weeks over a 15 year period, due to changes in winter snow pack and spring temperatures. I have studied the arrival biology of the mountain white-crowned sparrow for 15 years, evaluating the role of stress physiology in behavioral transitions from migration into nesting. In this presentation I will discuss data demonstrating that glucocorticoids extend flexibility during this migration/breeding transition: as winter-like conditions persist on the breeding site, glucocorticoids reverse the usual increased focus on the nesting site; higher glucocorticoids are associated with earlier territorial abandonment; and, exogenous glucocorticoids induce movement away from the breeding site down to lower elevation staging areas. Taken together, this glucocorticoid-induced increase in flexibility may enhance survival in years with more inclement weather.";"The University of Montana, Missoula, MT, United States"
"Kristal E Cain";"Response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) depends on social environment, but not color polymorphism in the Goulidan finch (Erythrura gouldiae)     (#93)";"Circulating testosterone (T) levels are\nassociated with social environment and season, but also with individual differences\nin trait expression and life-history strategy. In species with genetic\npolymorphisms, individual differences in trait expression and strategy have been exaggerated to separate morphs. Gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone is a neuropeptide released by the hypothalamus that stimulates the\nrelease of testosterone by the gonads. There are individual differences in how much T is\nreleased in response to an experimental surge of GnRH (a GnRH challenge), and\nthese differences are associated with differences in trait expression. Currently,\nit is unclear whether social environment and morph differences in T levels are due to\nperception (i.e. differences in GnRH secretion), or differences in how the\ngonads respond to GnRH. We begin to address this broad issue by examining the\neffect of morph and social environment in captive male Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae). Goulidan finches\nare genetically polymorphic; morphs differ in color and behavior, and these\ndifferences are associated with differences in circulating T levels. We examined\nT levels before and after a GnRH challenge in three different social\nenvironments to determine how social environment effects T produced in response\nto GnRH and whether there are morph differences in that response. We found that\nsocial environment significantly influenced T levels before and after a GnRH\nchallenge, but the direction of these differences changed across breeding stage.  However, there were no morph differences in the\namount of T produced in response to GnRH. Together, these results illustrate\nthat social environment can influence the ability of the gonads to respond to\nstimulus from the brain. Further, the lack of morph differences suggests that\nobserved morph differences in circulating T levels may be due to differences in\nperception rather than differences in gonad function or sensitivity (e.g.\nreceptor density). ";"Research School of Biology, Australian National University, Acton, ACT, Australia"
"Pierre Deviche";"Short-term regulation of social behavior by plasma testosterone in free-ranging male birds: Myth or reality?     (#94)";"Free-ranging birds have been used extensively to examine causal\nrelationships between short-term changes in plasma testosterone (T) and the\nexpression of androgen-dependent social behavior such as singing and aggressive\nresponses to conspecific males. Due to conflicting findings, the existence and\nespecially the generality of these relationships across species remain debated.\nOur work investigates this question using seasonally breeding, socially\nmonogamous, and territorial Sonoran Desert (USA) male passerines as experimental\nmodels. During the breeding season, an injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone\nor of luteinizing hormone to these birds rapidly increases plasma T, indicating\nthat plasma T secretion in unmanipulated birds is not maximum. Yet an acute social\nchallenge consisting of conspecific song playback with or without live decoy rapidly\nstimulates aggressive responses, but does not also elevate plasma T.\nFurthermore, there is no correlation either between the duration of this challenge\nand plasma T or between individual differences in plasma T and the expression\nof aggressive responses. These observations do not provide support to the\nhypothesis that social challenge rapidly upregulates plasma T or that plasma T\nlevels determine individual differences in behavior expression. To investigate whether\nplasma T is related to the expression of aggressive responses on a longer-term\nbasis, males were caught and restrained for 30 min to decrease plasma T, and\nthen released on territory. One day after release, plasma T remained well below\nthat of control (naïve) birds, yet the two groups of birds responded similarly\nto social challenge. Thus, depletion of plasma T for 24+ hours was not associated\nwith attenuated behavioral response to social challenge. Taken collectively, our\ndata do not suggest in the study species that circulating T levels during the breeding\nseason, when these levels are seasonally elevated, control aggressive behavior or\nrapidly respond to social interactions. Despite considerable effort and\nresearch on many species exhibiting various life history characteristics, the\nspecific parameters that determine whether such relationships are observed\nremain difficult to predict. ";"Arizona State University, Tempe, ARIZONA, United States"
"Simone Meddle";"The neuroendocrine control of avian parental behaviour     (#95)";"Nest building and incubation in birds is a complex, exquisite parental behaviour that is characterised by regression of the ovary, cessation of egg laying and increased maternal defence of the nest and chicks.  The neuroendocrine system plays a major role in regulating maternal behaviour in birds and changes in hormones such as prolactin and sex steroids are associated with this behaviour.  For example incubation onset may be associated by increased prolactin secretion induced by tactile contact with the eggs and nest and a reduced activity of the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.  However there are complex interactions between neuropeptides, environmental cues and neurotransmitters.  Surprisingly the links between the environment, genes responsible for avian parental behaviour and role of the neuroendocrine and central nervous system has still to be elucidated.  We have known for centuries, that broodiness in chickens is under genetic control, as different bird breeds display different levels of incubation tenacity.  In a recent study using cDNA chip analysis, 11 known genes were shown to be up-regulated in the hen’s brain when she displays maternal behaviour.  Excitingly, the mesotocin gene was one of those; mesotocin is a nonapeptide and the avian homologue of the hormone oxytocin.  Oxytocin, and the related neuropeptide vasopressin and their receptors have been shown in mammals (e.g. rodents) to be vital for controlling social behaviours including maternal behaviour and expression of these nonapeptides is regulated by gonadal steroids. Here I will review our latest findings highlighting the neuroendocrine mechanisms associated with reproductive behaviours in birds.   I will discuss the importance of nonapeptides in relation to nest building in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and the relationship of nonapeptide binding in the brain and changes in the HPA axis in relation to incubation and parental behaviour in free-living  birds such as the white crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys).

Few\nstudies have investigated the functional benefits of maintaining partner bonds\nacross reproductive bouts and no study to date has investigated the hormonal\nmechanisms associated with divorce. We divorced established pairs to examine\nthe effects of re-pairing on reproductive success in captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).  Additionally, we investigated one hormonal\npathway that could explain differences in reproductive success between pairs\nthat bred together repeatedly or those that were forced to re-pair: the\nrelationship between corticosterone (CORT; a steroid hormone involved in the\nstress response) and prolactin (a hormone implicated in parental care).  CORT is an important hormone for maintaining\nhomeostasis, but can negatively impact reproduction.  Although divorce and re-pairing increases\nCORT in some bird species, it is currently unknown how this affects prolactin\nlevels and reproductive success.  We\nfound that new pairs formed after divorce reared equal numbers of nestlings\ncompared to pairs allowed to breed iteratively with the same partners.  However, all pairs reared more nestlings in a\nsecond reproductive bout, suggesting that breeding experience is more important\nfor reproductive success than repeated experience with one partner.  Birds had lower levels of CORT in the second\nreproductive bout, but there was no difference between birds that had divorced (and\nre-paired) or not.  Additionally, CORT\nlevels predicted the latency to initiate breeding.  Neither breeding experience nor divorce\naffected prolactin levels and prolactin was not related to CORT levels.

Thus, selection can operate on these traits to produce evolutionary change.

"Anna Bastian";"Listening carefully: increased perceptual acuity for species discrimination in multispecies signalling assemblages     (#100)";"Communication is a fundamental component of evolutionary\nchange because of its role in mate choice and sexual selection. Acoustic\nsignals are a vital element of animal communication and sympatric species may\nuse private frequency bands to facilitate intraspeciﬁc communication and\nidentiﬁcation of conspeciﬁcs (acoustic communication hypothesis, ACH). If so,\nanimals should show increasing rates of misclassiﬁcation with increasing\noverlap in frequency between their own calls and those used by sympatric\nheterospeciﬁcs. We tested this on the echolocation of the horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus capensis, using a classical\nhabituation-dishabituation experiment in which we exposed R. capensis from two phonetic populations to echolocation calls of\nsympatric and allopatric horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus clivosus and Rhinolophus\ndamarensis) and different phonetic populations of R.capensis. As predicted by the ACH, R. capensis from both test populations were able to discriminate\nbetween their own calls and calls of the respective sympatric horseshoe bat\nspecies. However, only bats from one test population were able to discriminate\nbetween calls of allopatric heterospeciﬁcs and their own population when both were\nusing the same frequency. The local acoustic signalling assemblages (ensemble\nof signals from sympatric conspeciﬁcs and heterospeciﬁcs) of the two\npopulations differed in complexity as a result of contact with other phonetic\npopulations and sympatric heterospeciﬁcs. We therefore propose that a hierarchy of discrimination\nability has evolved within the same species. Frequency alone may be sufﬁcient\nto assess species membership in relatively simple acoustic assemblages but the\nability to use additional acoustic cues may have evolved in more complex\nacoustic assemblages to circumvent misidentiﬁcations as a result of the use of\noverlapping signals. When the acoustic signal design is under strong constraints\nas a result of dual functions and the available acoustic space is limited\nbecause of co-occurring species, species discrimination is mediated through\nimproved sensory acuity in the receiver.";"University of Cape Town, Cape Town, WESTERN CAPE, South Africa"

This has been argued to reflect the fact that cues to short-term fertility are more reliably signalled by bodies than by faces. In two studies, we probed this effect in more detail. In study 1,  266 volunteers completed an online measure of preferences for\ninformation from the face or body in short-term or long-term contexts, and\nvarious self-rated mate value measures. Information from the body was more\nimportant in short-term contexts for males (but not females), and correlated positively with mating strategy measures. Both sexes overestimated the\nopposite-sex’s preference for looking at the body, but women's estimates accurately reflected the effect of short- or long-term context on male preferences. In study 2, men were asked to consider the likelihood\nthat they would engage in a short-term relationship with one set of female stimuli, and\na long-term relationship with another set (order was counter-balanced between\nparticipants).

However, considerable debate surrounds the relative importance of historical\necological effects, such as pathogen loads, and current economic development in\ndriving plasticity in mate preferences. Here we attempt to shed new light on\nthis debate using two cross-cultural studies of facial attractiveness. In the\nfirst study, we quantified preferences for facial markers of health among Melanesian\npeople from Vanuatu. Preferences were compared between participants from three\nislands varying in malarial pathogens (pronounced, intermediate and absent) and\neconomic development (urban market-based economies and rural horticultural\ncommunities). We found that on islands with higher pathogen loads preferences\nwere stronger for symmetrical and less corpulent faces. However,\neffects involving economic development were, for the most part, not\nstatistically significant. In our second study, we quantified frequencies in\nmen’s beardedness and women’s preferences for beards using a large\ncross-cultural sample spanning more than 30 countries. We found that men are\nmore bearded and the attractiveness of beards is higher in larger more\ndeveloped cities, irrespective of cross-national variation in health and\npathogens. Taken together, results from these two studies suggest that within\nsmall-scale societies, historical ecological factors rather than contemporary economic\ndevelopment exert some influence on the direction of mate preferences. In\ncontrast, within multi-level industrialised societies, where people frequently encounter\nlarge numbers of anonymous individuals, the saliency of attractive traits is\nenhanced, largely independently of prevailing pathogens. Given that the\nmajority of recent cross-cultural research has focused on preferences from industrialized\ncountries, our findings have implications for some of the core assumptions in\nthis field.";"Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

The freshwater mussel Westralunio carteri, which is endemic to south-western Australia,\nhas undergone a 38% reduction in range in the last 50 years, and with global\nclimatic models predicting an increasingly warmer and dryer climate in the\nregion, reduced water flow presents a substantial extinction risk. We document\ntwo recent cases of mass mortality in populations of W. carteri, associated with drying rivers. In both cases, larger\nmussels were significantly overrepresented in the cohort of dead mussels,\ncompared to the surviving population. We hypothesised that this was due to\nsmaller mussels being either better at moving horizontally into deeper pools,\nor better at moving vertically into the substrate to escape drying. Experimental\nstudies found that the amount of horizontal movement by mussels was not\naffected by size, but there was a significant inverse relationship between the\ndepth of burrowing and mussel size. Furthermore, depth of burrowing\nsignificantly reduced mortality rate in mussels exposed to drying conditions,\nalthough this relationship was lost when mussels were shaded. These findings\nhave a number of implications: (1) predicted future reductions in water flow\nare likely to increase the mortality rate in W. carteri; (2) mortality risk will be greater for larger, older,\nmore fecund mussels, producing a disproportionate decrease in recruitment; (3)\nany factors which affect burrowing ability will have a synergistic effect on\nmortality rate; (4) the adverse effects of drying rivers may be at least\npartially averted by increasing riparian shading.";"Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"

"Gabriella Ljungström";"Some girls are more reactive than the norm - Sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) phenology in a warming world     (#75)";"Present-day climate change has altered the phenology (the timing of periodic life cycle events) of many plant and animal populations worldwide with varying concomitant effects on population fitness. Representing short-term responses to an altered weather regime, these changes are largely explained by phenotypic plasticity. However, for long-term persistence under climate change, evolutionary changes in phenological traits are likely to be needed, requiring among-individual genetic variation. In this study we use a large 15-year dataset on an ectotherm model, the Swedish sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), to investigate how inter-annual temperature variation affects oviposition date in a high latitude ectotherm, a trait strongly linked to offspring fitness and survival. With an interest in both short- and potential long-term consequences, a mixed-model random regression analysis was applied, yielding estimates of population plasticity and among-individual variation in the average, as well as the plastic, response to temperature. Our results indicate that climate warming is likely to have positive fitness effects in this lizard population through an advancement of oviposition date. This prediction is consistent over shorter and longer time scales as the analyses revealed both population-level plasticity and individual-level variation. These findings contrast general predictions of a global wide extinction risk of lizards as a result of climate change, and thus highlight the importance of accounting for evolutionary potential in behaviours in predictions of climate change effects on species and populations.";"Biological and Environmental Sciences, The University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden"
"Janne K Valkonen";"Resembling a viper: implications for the conservation of an endangered mimic     (#76)";"The phenomenon of Batesian mimicry, where a palatable animal gains protection against predation by resembling an unpalatable model, has been a core interest of evolutionary biologists for 150 years. An extensive range of studies has focused on revealing mechanistic aspects of mimicry and the evolutionary dynamics of mimicry systems and revealed that protective mimicry is widespread and is important for individual fitness. However, case studies where mimicry theories have been applied to conservation of mimetic species are rare. The theoretical implications of mimicry on conservation include, for example, frequency dependency of predator avoidance learning and preventing human induced mortality. We examined the case of the protected, endangered, non-venomous smooth snake (Coronella austriaca) that mimics the non-protected venomous viper (Vipera berus), both of which occur in the Åland archipelago, Finland. To quantify the added predation risk on smooth snakes caused by the rarity of vipers, we calculated risk estimates from experimental data. Resemblance of vipers enhances survival of smooth snakes against predation because many predators avoid touching venomous vipers. Mimetic resemblance is however disadvantageous against human predators, who kill vipers and accidentally kill endangered smooth snakes. Moreover, we found that the effective population size of the adders in Åland is very low relative to its smooth snake mimic. Because Batesian mimicry is advantageous for the mimic only if model species exist in sufficiently high numbers, it is likely that the conservation program for smooth snakes will fail if adders continue to be destroyed. Understanding the population consequences of mimetic species may be crucial to the success of endangered species conservation. We suggest that when a mimic requires protection, conservation planning should not ignore the model species even if it is not itself endangered.";"Department of biology and environmental science, Centre of excellence in biological interactions , University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland"

Yet,\nindividual foraging behaviour may itself also be influenced by social factors. The\ninteraction between sociality and foraging, and the feedback between the two, has\nfar-reaching implications for both of these processes, but current\nunderstanding is limited. We used automated experimental procedures within a\nlarge population of RFID tagged wild birds to experimentally dissect the\ninterplay between social and foraging behaviour. By experimentally manipulating\nwhere individual birds could access resources at automated feeding stations, we\ncould separate foraging and social behaviour. Imposing foraging restrictions increased\nassociation rates between birds in the same treatment class, and this assortment\nwas carried over into other social contexts, demonstrating how resource access\ncan influence social structure, and how effects at one level can carry-over\ninto other aspects of sociality. However, by considering mated pairs of birds within\nwhich conflicts over resource access were created experimentally, we also show that\nindividuals prioritised maintaining strong social relationships over access to\nresources, thus causing them to forage at non-optimal locations. In turn, this\ninfluenced the structure of their social network, showing how a single social\nrelationship between two individuals may govern their wider associations. Finally,\nwe show how ’conflicted’ pairs quickly learnt a flexible scrounging strategy,\ndemonstrating how behavioural plasticity can develop rapidly to mitigate the\ntrade-off between social relationships and other demands. In sum, we\ndemonstrate that whilst resource distribution may shape social networks, strong\nrelationships can be maintained regardless of external factors, and these\nrelationships subsequently feedback onto individuals’ social associations and\nforaging behaviour.";"Oxford University, Oxford, OXFORDSHIRE, United Kingdom"

Despite\nthis, research on the relative impacts of different types of predator in the\nsame system remain poorly known, largely due to the logistical challenges\ninvolved in monitoring multiple species. We overcame this challenge by\nutilising the presence of a naturally occurring sentinel, the Noisy Miner (Manorina melanocephala), a bird that\nproduces frequent alarm calls that are highly referential: different alarm\nsignals are given in the presence of either a ground-based predator, such as a\ncanid or snake, versus avian predators such as raptors.

Together, these results highlight\nthe complex nature of predation risk and how this varies with habitat structure,\nparticularly given group predators primarily target young birds, whilst aerial\npredators take miners of all ages.

(#254)";"The risk of predation is known to negatively affect many aspects of prey. They may kill or seriously injure them, reducing survival. The risk of predation also restricts the habitats animals use, both in size and quality. Moreover, it has physiological costs, such as increased oxidative damage and increase in stress hormone. It has also been proposed that predation has an energetic cost for the prey, which is represented by an instantaneous increase in the metabolic rate. The evidence supporting this hypothesis comes mostly from fishes, but little is known about the energetic cost of predation on invertebrates in general. Here, we present our experiments measuring the effect of a chemical predatory cue on the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of the Black Field Cricket (Teleogryllus commodus ). We predict that metabolic rate should increase when crickets are presented with chemical predatory cues. We also predict that this effect should be higher on females than males, since females are the ones looking for mates, while males only wait and call, making females more susceptible to predation. Â Finally, we predict that the increase of SRM will be preceded by an increase in the levels of octopamine, the stress hormone in insects. Our results confirm our first hypothesis. In fact, a significant increment of metabolic rate was found when predatory cues were added. However, this effect was stronger in males than in females. Also, octopamine does not seem to be causing the increase in metabolic rate, since the increase in this hormone does not temporally correlates with the increase in the CO2 produced by the crickets.";"Macquarie university, Sydney/Unima Beach, NSW, Australia"

What makes an ant scout is still\nenigmatic. Although sophisticated systems of distant homing are in\nmany respects similar in red wood ants and honey bees (Reznikova,\n2008), regulation of scouting completely differs in them. Whereas\nscouting honey bees change their roles from one foraging trip to\nanother (Beekman et al., 2007), scouting red wood ants perform the\nsame task during several weeks (Reznikova, 2011). To\nrevel distinctive features of scouts, we\ndesigned the first battery of behavioural\ntests which included peculiarities of exploratory activity, levels of\naggression and spatial cognition. In order\nto test exploratory activity, we recorded ethograms of individuals\nplaced in a box with artificial models of natural objects (a “tree\ntrunk”, “grass stems”, a “stone” and a “shelter”).\nAggressiveness was estimated from the variety of interactions with\nground beetles. The ability to memorize the path was investigated\nusing a binary-tree maze. A significant difference in cognition and\nbehaviour between scouts and foragers was revealed. Both scouts and\nforagers are more exploratory than “average” out-nest workers,\nand scouts exceed foragers. In unfamiliar situations scouts more\nreadily switch between different activities. Scouts and foragers\ndisplayed nearly equal levels of aggressiveness which are more than\nin aphid milkers and close to guards. In contrast to guards, both\nscouts and foragers strongly avoided aggressive actions which may be\nof danger to themselves, and they never attacked beetles directly.\nThe most distinctive feature of scouts is their high exploratory\nactivity: facing novel items scouts readily advance to explore them.\nScouts also form spatial memory faster and keep the information\nlonger and more precisely than foragers.

"Stefan Fischer";"How multiple early experiences influence anti-predator behaviours in a cooperatively breeding cichlid.     (#137)";"Predation is a strong force of natural selection and therefore the development of skills to successfully evade predator attacks are highly beneficial. However, acquiring these skills needs time and energy, which may constrain the resources available for acquiring other vital ecological or social skills. Therefore individuals should only strongly invest in the development of predator evasion skills if in the future environment high predation threat is expected. We predicted that individuals experiencing dangerous environments during critical periods early in life might invest more in the development of predator evasion skills than individuals experiencing a safe early environment. In a long-term developmental experiment with the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher we manipulated the juvenile’s early perception of safety. In a 2x2 factorial design we varied the perceived predation risk as well as the social environment by raising juveniles with or without older group members. During the experience phase of 2 months we repeatedly measured the growth of all juveniles. To analyse their acquisition of predator evasion skills we performed two tests after the experience phase. The “predator discrimination test” tested the ability to discriminate between a dangerous predator and a harmless herbivore. The “egg predator test” tested for the ability to defend a brood produced by a dominant breeder pair when being a subordinate helper. During the experience phase test fish exposed to predators had a faster growth rate resulting in larger body size and thus reduced size-dependent predation risk. Interestingly, anti predator behaviours were interactively influenced by both early experiences when confronted with a dangerous predator but not when confronted with a herbivore or egg predator. We discuss how early experience might predispose individuals for their future life in a species where predation threat is a major force of the evolution of sociality.";"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"

The\nformer strategy carries costs in terms of predation risk, while the latter\ntrades-off against foraging for food; both trade-offs may be influenced by an\nindividual’s developmental history. Here, we consider a possible role of early developmental experience in inducing different mass regulation and\nforaging strategies in European starlings. We measured the\nbody mass, body condition, foraging effort, food consumption and information gathering\n(contrafreeloading) of birds that had previously undergone a subtle early-life\nmanipulation of food competition that impacted developmental stress biomarkers,\nbut did not affect growth. We found that developmentally\ndisadvantaged birds were fatter in adulthood and differed in foraging behaviour\ncompared to their advantaged siblings. Disadvantaged birds were hyperphagic compared\nto advantaged birds, but only following a period of food-deprivation.  Disadvantaged birds spent more time\ncontrafreeloading than advantaged birds.

We used a needle trap system to gather volatile compounds from food deprived honey bee larvae, fed larvae and larval food. Analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, identified E-β-Ocimene as a possible candidate for hungry signal from honey bee larvae. E-β-ocimene was detected from both 2d and 4d worker, drone and queen larvae and more was detected from starving larvae than fed larvae and from larval food. RNA-sequence analysis indicated that 14 genes were involved in the E-β-Ocimene biosynthetic pathway but these were not significantly differently expressed between starving larvae and fed larvae.  These results suggest that E-β-ocimene is a candidate for a “hungry-signal” pheromone for honey bee larvae and is denovo synthesised by the larva, but its biosynthesis process may be regulated by other means.";"Biological science, Macquarie University, Sydney"

"Robert NV Raw";"It’s not all about the soprano - How different components of echolocation influence communication in horseshoe bats.     (#235)";"Acoustic systems with dual functions offer an interesting view into the evolution of animal communication systems.Â Bat echolocation has evolved primarily for orientation and foraging and these functions largely determine the acoustic parameters of echolocation calls. However, small variations in the parameters of echolocation calls, both within and between species, have the potential to encode species and individual identity, raising the possibility that echolocation calls also function in communication. Recent behavioural studies have demonstrated the ability of bats to discriminate between several different classes of individuals bases on echolocation call alone, supporting a communicative function for echolocation. Although call frequency appears to be the parameter most often used to discriminate between classes of individuals, there is evidence that other parameters, not yet identified, may also be implicated. Using a series of playback experiments on captive Horseshoe bats, I have teased apart individual components of echolocation to ascertain which components provide sufficient cues for discrimination between species. In addition to the frequency of the constant frequency component of the calls, duty cycle and the bandwidth of the initial and terminal frequency modulated components of calls exhibited individual signatures. Bats were able to use all of these parameters to discriminate between different classes of individuals, the most important of which will be discussed. The role of echolocation in mate choice was also investigated using a two-alternative forced choice playback experiment. Bats were presented with different acoustic stimuli based on sex and body condition and observations were made of the preference shown towards each class of playback. Preference for playbacks of echolocation calls from the opposite sex or from individuals with a higher body condition was indicative of potential mate choice via echolocation.";"University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa"

"Josefina Zidar";"What shapes optimism in chicks?     (#154)";"Animal cognition and thus the way animals interpret their surroundings can include biases. ‘Cognitive judgment bias’ is one type of cognitive bias. This bias can be positive or negative, resulting in more optimistic or pessimistic interpretation of stimuli. Such optimism or pessimism can be tested when observing responses to ambiguous cues intermediate of cues with known positive and negative values. To investigate factors affecting cognitive judgement biases in avian cognition, we conducted several experiments with young domestic and red junglefowl (Gallus gallus ssp.). To explore the influence of environmental differences on optimism, young chicks were raised under enriched or impoverished conditions. Cognitive judgment bias tests were performed before and after exposing chicks to a battery of stressors. Prior to being stressed, behavioural responses to ambiguous cues did not differ between individuals from the two treatments. However, chicks in enriched conditions showed higher resilience to stress by being more optimistic in the subsequent cognitive judgment bias test, compared to chicks in impoverished conditions. This suggests that environmental complexity early in life can buffer against negative responses to future stress, and that environmental conditions can influence optimism. Personality (i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour) can also influence how individuals respond to stimuli. In another experiment we therefore explore the extent to which personality of individuals explain their level of optimism, by exposing chicks reared under similar conditions and with known personalities, to cognitive bias tests. Underlying variation in the monoaminergic systems (serotonin and dopamine) of our test birds will be investigated to further our understanding of proximate explanations to variation in optimism among individuals. Taken together, these studies improve our understanding of variation in cognitive judgement biases, and highlight factors influencing variation in optimism.

We use red wood ants Formica aquilonia with whom passerine birds share territories in forest habitats. Our experiments reflect the natural situation when great tits face aggressive red wood ants within tree crowns and sometimes use them to feed chicks.

Then the bird was allowed to enter the working part of the cage where it could choose between two glass feeders (“food patches”) containing ant groups of different quantities, from 5 to 50. Ants behaved rather aggressively, and they served both as food items and as a source of danger. We found that birds choose at random between 5 and 10, and they prefer more ants when choosing between 10 and 25. This means that tits value ants as food and quantities in this range do not bother them much. However they always go for the smaller quantity when choosing between 10 and 50 ants, thus displaying the capacity for distinguishing between more and less in order to ensure comfortable hunting.The study has been supported by the Russian Scientific Fund (14-14-00603)";"Laboratory of Community Ethology, Institute of Systematic and Ecology of Animals Siberian Branch RAS, Novosibirsk, Novosibirsk region, Russia"

Alternatively, they may\nshow a gradual change in response to an altered reward. Studies of birds have, to date, shown a lack of\nconsistency in the responses found. The aim of this study was therefore to\ncharacterise behavioural and physiological responses to a reward alteration and\nto identify potential indicators of a change in expectation in chickens.\nSixteen chickens were trained in a runway apparatus to expect a mealworm\nreward. During testing, which consisted of 10 consecutive trials, all chickens\nwere fed mealworms in their first trial. From the second trial onwards, the\nreward was unexpectedly altered to a seed-mix for half the birds (contrast\ngroup); the rest of the birds (control group) continued to be fed mealworms.\nBehaviour (the number of head movements during a reward viewing period and\nlatency to reward) and physiology (reward heart rate (HR) and eye and maximum\nhead temperature) were monitored during each trial to assess responses to\nreward alteration. After the reward had been altered, latency to reach the reward significantly increased\nand the number of head movements and reward HR significantly decreased across\nthe remaining trials for the contrast group, when compared with the control\ngroup. However, those significant differences were not apparent in the first trial\nafter the reward was altered. The general decrease in arousal shown by chickens\nin the contrast group suggests that they changed their expectations gradually,\nrather than showing immediate frustration-like responses. Moreover, our study\nindicates that the measures of arousal used here are appropriate indicators of\na change in expectation in chickens.   ";"School of Clinical Veterinary Science , University of Bristol, Langford House, Langford, Bristol, BS40 5DU, UK"
"Giselle Muschett";"Do males prefer unmated females? Male mate choice in the chameleon grasshopper Kosciuscola tristis     (#159)";"Males of many species choose their mate\naccording to a females’ reproductive status. Mated females can differ in their\nchemical or behavioural cues and these differences provide males with\ninformation her status. Most studies report a preference for unmated females\nbut this is reliant on the particular mating system. Males of the chameleon\ngrasshopper Kosciuscola tristis frequently\nengage in aggressive combat over access to females, a very rarely reported\nbehaviour in grasshoppers. Females have been observed mating multiple times\nunder laboratory conditions, but it is uncertain whether there is sperm\ntransfer in subsequent matings. Studies suggest that under polyandrous systems there\nshould be selective pressure on males to discern a females’ mating status and\nmate preferentially with unmated females. To test this hypothesis, we ran mate\nchoice experiments where one male chose between a mated and an unmated female in\na semi-natural mating arena. We found that males did not discriminate between mated\nand unmated females and readily started to copulate with either in equal\nproportions. However, males mated much longer – up to 10 times longer, with\nunmated females than with mated females. Our results suggest K. tristis females do not significantly\nchange their behaviour nor produce any specific pheromones post-copula that\nindicate their mating status. As such, males show no pre-copulatory selection\nmechanism. We speculate there must be post-copulatory selection mechanism in\nthis species and males may be transferring a spermathecal “plug”, preventing any\nfuture spermatophore transfer. While research on spermathecal plugs in\ngrasshoppers is limited (Thomas, 2011), Hartman and Loher, (1999) reported that\nthe empty spermatophore of male gomphocerine grasshoppers acts as a temporary plug\nin the female’s spermathecal duct.

Perceptual biases\npresent in the receiver can create an inaccurate or incomplete perception of the\nenvironment, leading to sub-optimal decision-making. In mate choice, males can\ntake advantage of this biased cognitive perception by creating illusions in\nmating signals to which females are susceptible. I tested this using the\nsailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna) where\nthe males show significant variation in body size and females prefer the\nlargest males. If males were able to adaptively choose who they associate with,\nand strategically position themselves within a social group, they may increase\ntheir mating success. I predicted that males are able to do this by creating a\ndeceptive illusion to make them appear larger, and therefore more attractive. I\nused a preference function test to quantify the change in female preference for\na male by sequentially presenting the same male in different social contexts\nand environmental treatments, and measuring both the female’s and male’s\nresponse. I will present data from experiments testing female preference for\nmales in different social contexts, mimicking the Ebbinghaus illusion, by using\nboth live stimulus males and clay models.";"University of Oklahoma, Norman, OKLAHOMA, United States"
"Theresa Rueger";"Size matters to males and females: mutual mate choice leads to size assortative pairing in a paternal mouthbrooding coral reef cardinalfish     (#161)";"Many animals exhibit size-assortative mating where reproductive\npairs are more similar in size than expected through random mating.  Matching theory predicts this occurs because\nboth males and females prefer and will leave existing partners for bigger mates.  Monogamous pairing and size-assortative\nmating has been described for coral reef fishes, but the underlying behavioural\nmechanism has not been tested. Here we took a long-term observational and\nexperimental study to resolve the causes of size-based pairing in the mouthbrooding\ncoral reef cardinalfish Sphaeramia\nnematoptera.  For 65 pairs observed over\na 23 month period, there was a strong correlation between male and female size.  This size assortative mating was not\nincidental through growing up together, since only 28% of juvenile pairs were\nstill found together after four months, and only 7% after eight months.  For those changing partners over this period,\nthere was a strong correlation between the sizes of individuals and their new\npartners, with individuals only ever leaving partners for larger mates.  We experimentally removed 16 males and 18\nfemale partners from existing pairs to examine the role of male and female mate\npreferences in leading to size-assortative mating.  The strong positive relationship between the\nsizes of male and female partners was maintained as individuals found new\npartners.  Both females and males chose\nsimilar sized partners after both natural losses and following mate removal,\nindicating both sexes exhibit a mutual preference for partners of near similar\nsize.  We suggest that monogamous pairing\noccurs in cardinalfish because mouthbrooding restricts multiple mating by males.\nSize assortative pairing follows as larger males prefer the more fecund larger\nfemales, and larger females prefer larger males because they can successfully brood\nall of their eggs.

The search for the genetic basis of fitness variation has until recently often relied on neutral genetic markers, including mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites. However, ecological and evolutionary processes relevant to fitness can only be inferred by non-neutral genes such as those of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC variants, including ‘supertypes’ (i.e. clusters of MHC variants which encode peptides that interact with particular types of antigens) influence many important biological traits in vertebrates. MHC variation has previously been associated with direct and indirect fitness traits, and has been shown to play an important role in mating. In this study we investigated the potential relationship between MHC variation and fitness traits in two populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. aduncus) in Western Australia. We used conventional Sanger and Illumina MiSeq next-gen sequencing methods to infer MHC sequence variants and supertypes. MHC variation was compared to mate choice, reproductive success, male alliance formation and survival to old age in hundreds of dolphins.

"Corinna von Kuerthy";"Contest vs. scramble competition and androgen responsivenesss of males pursuing fixed and plastic alternative reproductive tactics     (#163)";"Reproductive investment and aggression patterns typically diverge between individuals pursuing alternative reproductive\ntactics (ARTs). Evolutionary theory predicts that the relative frequencies of\nalternative male genotypes in a population are stabilized by negative frequency\ndependence, implying that competition is greatest between males pursuing the\nsame tactic. Males of the\ncichlid fish Lamprologus callipterus exhibit\nthree ARTs involving both fixed and plastic alternative behaviours. Large bourgeois males defend territories and\nconstruct nests of empty snail shells in which females breed. In contrast, males pursuing the genetically fixed dwarf\ntactic do not court but enter shells surreptitiously during spawning in order to obtain fertilizations. Finally, males pursuing a plastic and conditional\nsneaker tactic enter nests during spawning to opportunistically steal fertilizations\nfrom nest owners. In an experiment we exposed males pursuing divergent ARTs to\nrivals of same and different tactics and intensities of reproductive competition.\nThe prediction of tactic specific\naggression was confirmed in bourgeois nest males. In\ncontrast, parasitic males exhibit scramble competition, as rapid responses to\nupcoming opportunities for parasitic reproduction are apparently selected. The\ndifferences between males pursuing\nfixed and plastic ARTs is reflected also in the control of reproductive and\ncompetitive behaviour by androgens. Interestingly, males pursuing the\ngenetically fixed parasitic dwarf male tactic exceeded other males both in 11-ketotestosterone\nand testosterone levels. The former is the major active androgen controlling\nreproduction in male teleosts, whereas the latter has more varied functions in\nthe regulation of fish behaviour. Experimental variation in competition and\nsocial context affected androgen levels only in bourgeois males, and their experimentally\ntriggered androgen responses correlated significantly with the expression of aggressive\nbehaviour. These data reveal that reproductive and aggressive behaviours\nrespond differently to social challenges in a species with fixed and plastic\nARTs, which is reflected by divergent regulation of behaviour by androgens.";"Behavioural Ecology, University of Bern, Hinterkappelen, Switzerland"

Even though bats display the widest range of\nmating behaviours of all mammalian Orders, lek breeding is disproportionally\nrare with only one confirmed lek-breeding species. This rarity is an anomaly,\nas bats possess all of the necessary prerequisites for lek evolution.

During the\nbreeding season males establish night roosts in tree cavities and sing to\nattract passing females, who visit these ‘singing roosts’ to mate with the\nresident males. Spatial logistic regressions indicate singing roosts are\nclustered around large communal roosts used by females, providing evidence of a\n“resource-based lek” – i.e. males aggregating near resources required by\nfemales to increase female-encounter rates. Additionally, transponder records\nat singing roosts show that multiple males ‘share’ singing duties, a\npotentially unique behaviour amongst both bats and lekking species. I have also\nused male song characteristics, combined with morphometrics and genetic\nanalyses to determine factors important in female selection of mates.

Among\nsuch taxa, the blue mussel (Mytilus\ngalloprovincialis) offers a powerful model system for studying gamete\ninteractions during sperm competition – where ejaculates from multiple males\ncompete for fertilisations. This is because mussels inherit mitochondria from\nboth the eggs of mothers and the sperm of fathers.

I present the results\nof a study testing the efficacy of this technique, by comparing swimming\nbehaviour and fertilisation ability of dyed and undyed sperm samples from the\nsame males. I found no effect of the dye on sperm traits or fertilisation and\ntherefore propose it as a feasible technique for tracking the individual\nsuccess of ejaculates during sperm competition. The technique was then used to\nexplore the potential role of egg chemoattractants as a novel mediator of sperm\ncompetition. Sperm from different males preferentially swim toward\nchemoattractants from different females in M.\ngalloprovincialis. The dye technique allows assessment of the success of\ncompeting sperm in the presence of chemoattractants from different females, and\ntherefore determination of whether chemoattractants act in female interests, allowing them\nto choose among competing sperm. Finally, I examine the mechanisms underlying these\ngamete interactions.

The Australian sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa) establishes non-random social networks that are characterised by avoidance of some individuals, and frequent interactions with an opposite sex individual reflecting the pair-living social organisation. We experimentally increased habitat complexity in two populations by adding maze-like structures and compared the social dynamics of those populations to two control populations. We used data from GPS-tracking all adult individuals every ten minutes in these populations to construct social networks based on spatial proximity of individuals. Social connectivity (network density) and social stability across weekly intervals were greater in populations with higher habitat complexity than in control populations. Social differentiation (coefficient of variation of dyadic association frequencies) reflecting the pair-living social organisation remained similar. Greater social connectivity resulted in higher rates of agonistic interactions, shown by higher individual scale damage in those populations. Furthermore, males and females that interacted most often with a same sex individual had greater scale damage, suggesting that intra-sexual competition among both sexes shaped the social structure.";"Flinders University, Bedford Park, SA, Australia"
"Marian Wong";"Conflict and Cooperation in Animal Groups: A Tale of Coral-Reef Fishes     (#215)";"Social queues, in which subordinates wait their turn to inherit dominant breeding status, are a familiar feature of animal societies. However, little is known about the mechanisms stabilising groups and queues given conflict over rank. Here, we report the role of punishment and cooperation in promoting the stability of size-based queues in a coral-dwelling goby, Paragobiodon xanthosomus. Quantitative analysis of the size-structure of queues revealed that individuals of adjacent rank differed in size by a specific size ratio, and comparisons of individual group rates demonstrated that specific size ratios are maintained over time via the regulation of subordinate growth. Furthermore, contest experiments demonstrated that the specific size ratio is a threshold above which subordinates become a threat to their immediate dominant, and as a result, dominants evict subordinates that exceed this ratio. We propose that threshold size ratios are maintained by subordinates as a form of peaceful cooperation whereby they avoid inflicting costs on dominants, and that such cooperation arises in response to the threat of punishment in the form of eviction. Society stability is therefore achieved through the effects of punishment and cooperation acting in concert to promote resolution of conflict over rank.";"University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"

The training of shy generic individuals always had very little influence.\nColonies containing informed keystones, whose training matched their\nenvironment, quickly learned to attack the profitable stimulus in large numbers\nand to avoid the unrewarding stimulus. In contrast, colonies containing\nmisinformed keystones, whose training mismatched their environment, never\nlearned to attack the rewarding stimulus, resulting in massive die-offs within\ncolonies. Thus, the consequences of information quality on societal success\ndepended on the influence of its original bearers, where information quality in\nthe hands of keystones determines whether their colonies flourish or\nwither.  ";"University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PENNSYLVANIA, United States"

(#183)";"Parasitism may\naffect animal personality traits and behavioural syndromes in subtle ways,\nwhich may be overlooked by comparing mean trait values between infected and\nuninfected groups. Infection may alter host personality by changing the\nconsistency of a host’s behavioural response over time, or may affect\nbehavioural syndromes by decoupling behavioural traits or changing the way they\ncorrelate with each other. This study aimed to test these predictions in a Toxoplasma gondii-mouse model. It is\nbelieved that T. gondii manipulates a\nrange of behaviours in rodents to make them more likely to be caught by cats,\nthus increasing transmission of the parasite to its definitive host. However,\nindividual differences in behaviour have rarely been considered. We assessed\nindividual behaviour of experimentally infected and uninfected female laboratory\nmice in three behavioural tests (the elevated plus maze; EPM, and the open\nfield; OF, and a predator odour avoidance arena; POAA) at five time points over\n6 months. We characterised mouse personality using exploratory factor analysis to\ndefine two main factors for the EPM and OF; EPM activity, EPM boldness, OF\nactivity and OF boldness.

It has recently been proposed that\nphysiology is one such mechanism. Current research focuses primarily on the\nlink between metabolic rate and personality with little emphasis of other\nphysiological traits. Considering the effects of temperature on behaviour in\nectotherms, it is likely that variation in thermal physiology at the individual\nlevel may reflect variation in personality. Accordingly, we assessed the\nco-variation between personality and thermal traits in the delicate skink (Lampropholis\ndelicata) by measuring the thermal preferences and optimal performance temperature\nand a range of personality traits.

An association between immune strategy and personality is\nlikely from a mechanistic perspective also: behavioural syndromes are\nassociated with different activities of the stress response systems, that is\nintricately linked with immunity. Here we test the association between\nindividual coping style and innate immune defences in a bird, the superb\nfairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus. We focus on innate immune\ndefenses since these form a critical, non-specific first line of defense\nagainst invaders. We also estimated stress experienced by the birds from blood\nparameters. Modulation of immune defense in response to external environment\nwas evident for two of three innate immune parameters.

They use highly stereotypical\nmovements to reduce the number of variables required to execute a task. The\nkinematics of two goal directed patterns have been well stereotyped –\n‘reaching’ and ‘fetching’. Reaching involves extension of the arm by\npropagating a bend along a linear plane of the arm. Fetching uses\nquasi-articulated structures to combine localized stiffening with multiple bend\npoints that behave like temporary joints. These quasi-articulated systems use\nprinciples of levers to maximize either displacement or force depending on\nlocation of the pivot or joint. All of these descriptions have been made under\nlab controlled conditions specifying a stationary target goal. We observed\nsimilar movement patterns in the field while studying Abdopus sp. in\nOkinawa, Japan. Individuals used arm extensions to ‘punch’ goby fish away from\ntheir territory. Mather and Mather (1994) described this behavior as ‘arm slap’\nand is meant to deter rather than capture the fish. One arm or two arms, either\nlateral or anterior, were recruited for punching. The arms started held up in\nan upright posture with tips completely curled. Upon extension from the base of\nthe arm to the tip, the proximal segment stiffened, acting like a rigid body.\nThis was followed by unfurling of the tips starting medially by bend\npropagation. This punching pattern appears to use principles from both the\nreaching and fetching patterns, creating bend propagation at the tip and a\nquasi-joint medially adjacent to a stiffened base, but maybe optimized for\nforce amplification more than movement amplification.

In systems where males search for females via\npheromone plumes, it is often difficult to assess whether female signaling is\ncostly. Direct costs include the energetics of pheromone synthesis and\nemission, and attention from unwanted eavesdroppers such as parasites, parasitoids\nand predators. Suboptimal outcomes are also possible from too many or too few\nmating events, or near simultaneous arrival of males who make unwanted mating\nattempts (even if successfully thwarted).

Imprinting via the\nparents' host complements innate recognition, leading to rigid species-specific\nhost recognition. Imprinting by the parents' single host provides a sufficient\ncue for reaching the two host species.

However, the rates of intrasexual\naggression are lower in high versus low chronic predation-risk populations in\nthe absence of an imminent threat, suggesting that the predation-related costs\nof aggression are high enough to counter the prediction of the RAH. Instead,\nmales from high chronic-risk populations seem to favor mating attempts when no\npredator is present to increase their reproductive success. The aim of our\nstudy was to examine the impact of acute predation threats on these patterns of\nmating competition. Under\nlaboratory conditions, we explored the combined effects of acute predation (low\nrisk vs. high risk), chronic predation (low ambient predation risk vs. high\nambient predation risk), and OSR (i.e. 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) on mating competition\nin male and female wild-caught Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata).

"Carel ten Cate";"Avian cognition from a comparative perspective – an introduction     (#197)";"Studying animal cognition is becoming a progressively important subfield of the study of animal behaviour. Research has demonstrated that an increasing number of species are able to cope with complex physical problems, show remarkable perceptual abilities and learning skills or have an amazing understanding of social relationships. This includes abilities reminiscent of, or comparable to, those long thought unique to humans. In search for the roots of human cognition, many comparative studies use mammals, from rats to apes, to search for potential homologues that may shed light on the evolution of advanced cognitive traits in humans. The Avian Cognition symposium deals with a phylogenetically quite distant group: birds. Birds are widely studied in research on animal behaviour and behavioural ecology. However, they also provide excellent model species for addressing questions about animal cognition, both in their own right and from a comparative perspective. Recent research has shown that various bird species show advanced cognitive abilities that match those of mammals up to the level of primates. Also, bird brains, although different in structure from mammalian brains, have undergone a parallel evolution towards brain areas analogous to the mammalian cortex. This symposium aims for an exploration of avian cognitive abilities: What are they like? In my introduction, I will focus in particular on the comparative question: to what extent are the abilities of birds similar to those of mammals and what, if anything, can birds tell us about human cognition and its evolution? I will do so by selecting a few telling examples, also illustrating how research on birds has helped or may help to provide hypotheses about human cognitive abilities. ";"Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands"

"Utku Urhan";"Numerical Competence in Great tits (Parus major)     (#199)";"In a strict sense, the abilities to count and to understand abstract numbers are unique human abilities. However, quantity discrimination studies conducted during the last decades have shown that also non-human animals in various taxa, from ants to birds and chimpanzees, have basic number related skills. In nature, the ability to perceive quantities and to understand the difference between different quantities can be advantageous in many situations. The great tit is a generalist forager that is known as an innovative species. Some recent studies have shown that it is cognitively advanced compared to many other passerines. We tested 10 great tits for their numerical competence under laboratory conditions. The birds were presented two sets of food items (meal worms) that differed in numbers and had to choose between these. The meal worms were presented as discrete units (in separate small petri dishes).  This occurred in a cage that was designed so that the birds could access only one of these two sets of food items. The birds were considered to be successful if they selected the set of food items with the higher quantity. In total, the birds were offered 15 different pairs of quantities with five different ratios. Our results indicate that great tits posses an ability to distinguish the difference between quantities regardless of the ratio, if number of items in one set do not exceed four. Moreover, for quantities that are higher than four, the birds’ ability to make the correct choice between two different quantities improves as the ratio between quantities is increased.";"Lund University, Lund, SKÅNE, Sweden"

(#200)";"Inference by exclusion, the ability to base\nchoices on the systematic exclusion of alternatives [1], has been investigated\nin a broad range of non-human species throughout the past decades [1-27]. However, the majority of\nmethodologies that have been employed are difficult to be compared directly, as\nthey rarely take into consideration behavioural predispositions (e.g.\nneophobia, explorative tendencies, etc.) differing between species.\nFurthermore, previous studies found individuals frequently rely on cognitively\nless demanding strategies rather than logically excluding alternatives [26, 27],\nbut fail to integrate these findings into a framework that could account for\nthe use of multiple strategies. Here, we present an approach that refrains from\ntesting for one cognitive skill in the common ‘all or nothing’ fashion. Instead,\nthis method allows for a more graded qualitative analysis of response behaviour\nby using an abstract two-choice task on a touch-screen, which is equally\nfeasible for a large variety of species [2]. The task has so far been tested\nwith two large brained parrot species, both of which are known to be very\ninvestigative and curious: Goffin cockatoos (Cacatua goffini) and kea (Nestor\nnotabilis). While Goffin cockatoos have been shown to be able to make\ninferences in the functional domain [28],\nkea were tested and failed in a previous exclusion task [23]. These species\nwere selected to test robustness of the approach with respect to neophilia [29-31], a feature rarely controlled\nfor in previous studies. While individuals of both species exhibited responses\nindicative of inference by exclusion significantly above chance, other response\nstrategies also seem to have guided their choices to some degree. The results\nof the current study highlight the importance of considering alternative\nresponse strategies, e.g. novelty aversion, stimulus avoidance or one-trial\nlearning, and how these might overshadow more advanced cognitive abilities,\nsuch as reasoning by exclusion, leading to misconceptions about the\nevolutionary origins of such skills.";"Department for Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"

In another study, we evaluated relative pitch perception in\nthe black-capped chickadee.

"Erin L Macartney";"An investigation of the direct and trans-generational costs of ejaculate depletion in Telostylinus angusticollis     (#203)";"Males can be limited by the number of ejaculates that can be produced, as well as the quality of ejaculate transferred. This may be costly not only due to the possibility of decreased fertilisation potential, but due to the decrease of components found in the semen such as seminal fluid protiens (SFPs) that can stimulate oviposition and influence paternal effects. It is known that frequent mating can reduce the number of progeny sired by the male, however it is not known if frequent mating can also decrease paternal effects. In this study, we investigate the consequences of ejaculate depletion in the Australian neriid fly, Telostylinus angusticollis. Males were either allowed to mate frequently over 6 hours (mated treatment) or exposed to females but prevented from mating (non-mated treatment), and then paired with a standard virgin female to quantify male mating rate, reproductive output and paternal effects on offspring viability and condition. Although males from the mated treatment exhibited reduced mating rate following the treatment period, there was little evidence of a cost of previous mating in terms of reproductive output or paternal effects. However, mating treatment affected the rate of reduction in male accessory gland size with each subsequent mating, and accessory gland size affected larval viabilty. These results indicate that males of T. angusticollis do not suffer an obvious cost to frequent mating on reproductive performance. However, these results suggest that frequent mating depletes the accessory glands, with potential consequences for offspring viability.";"University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

"Thierry Hance";"When inbreeding avoidance does not required kin recognition in a quasi-gregarious aphid parasitoid.     (#206)";"Mechanisms for\ninbreeding avoidance should be prevalent in insects that reproduce by\narrhenotokous haplodiploidy because of the high potential production of\nunviable diploid males in inbred mating. It is\nparticularly the case of aphid parasitoids that are\nusually considered as quasi-gregarious with a high level of local mate\ncompetition between sibs. Moreover, in some species, such as Aphidius matricariae, it seems that\nthere is no recognition between related individuals and a sister brought into\nthe presence of his brother generally accepted mating. Therefore, our\nhypothesis is that there is a series of mechanisms that minimize the encounter\nbetween two related individuals emerging from the same colony of aphids and that\naphid parasitoid therefore are not actually semi-gregarious.In that context, we have studied the steps\npreceding mating from the egg laying by a female in a colony of aphids until\nthe emergence of her daughters and sons to analyse their mating probability. It\nappears that first, when attacking a colony, the mother female causes the\ndispersal of a part of parasitized or not parasitized aphids and that these\naphids move then to different places of the plant or on nearby plants where they\nresettle. Secondly, the male development time is significantly shorter than\nthat of females and their emergence pattern is different. Finally, in most\ncases, from the emergence, male and female parasitoids quickly leave the aphid\ncolony in search of another colony before searching for a mate. The combination\nof these three mechanisms gives an extremely low probability of a sib mating.\nIn this way, the costs associated with risk of inbreeding in these haplodiploid\nparasitoids are very small while avoiding the necessity of related recognition\nprocess.";"Earth and Life Institute, UCL, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"

Differences in the perception of pain and in the need for pain medication between different barn types (tie stalls or free stalls) and farms with a heard health agreement with a vet or not were evaluated. Furthermore, we tested for differences between farms that report they always, sometimes or never have a vet medicate calves before disbudding. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (using Bonferroni corrections when appropriate) were used. Disbudding was practiced on 72% of the farms.

Eviction, therefore, is an important determinant of population\nstructure and demography, but little is known about what factors trigger such\nevents. Three main explanations for patterns of eviction are (1) the\nreproductive competition hypothesis; (2) the coercion of cooperation\nhypothesis; and (3) the adaptive forced dispersal hypothesis. The last\nhypothesis proposes that dominant individuals use eviction as an adaptive\nstrategy to propagate copies of their alleles through a highly structured population.\nHere we test these three hypotheses as explanations for observed eviction\nevents in cooperatively breeding banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), using a 16 year database on life history, behaviour\nand genetic relatedness.  In this species\ngroups of females, or mixed sex groups of males and females, are periodically\nevicted en masse. Our results suggest that reproductive competition is the main\nproximate trigger for eviction for both sexes. We find no evidence to suggest\nthat eviction is used to coerce helping, or that eviction is an adaptive\nmechanism to force dispersal of related individuals into the wider population.\nEviction of females changes the landscape of reproductive competition for\nremaining males, which can explain why males are often evicted (or inclined to\nleave) en masse alongside females, but then disperse in separate groups.

We conclude that male mice cannot maintain the\nproduction of sexually attractive signals while responding to an infection and\nthus are not able to conceal symptoms of sickness when presented with an\nopportunity to mate. Females in estrus might use these cues when making mating\ndecisions, since they prefer to spend more time near Control-injected males.\nTestosterone was reduced in LPS-injected males and could be a unifying\nmechanism down-regulating both of the traits quantified, since it is known that\nboth traits are under androgenic influence.

"Nikolaus von Engelhardt";"Unexpected reproductive performance of male zebra finches in relation to early and current social conditions     (#178)";"The social environment during adolescence affects adult behaviour in many species, but the functional significance of these effects is not well understood. Zebra finches are highly social colonial breeders but sometimes breed at a distance from others. Early social environment may thus predict adult reproductive competition. We found earlier that males growing up in a group show less courtship and aggression as adults than males reared in pairs. The behaviour of pair-reared males may be beneficial at low densities but detrimental when breeding colonially. We tested this by comparing reproductive performance of pair- and group-reared males under low density (two males and one female) and high density (5 males and 4 females) social environments. Suprisingly, pair-reared males produced more offspring under high densities, whereas group-reared males were more successful under low density. Although this match-mismatch effect supports the idea that male behaviour is adaptively shaped by the early social environment, it is also clear that the influence of adult social conditions is more complex than expected. Reproductive success also appeared to enhance male aggressiveness and reduce male courtship. This contrasts with permanent effects of the adolescent social environment found earlier. The most likely explanation is that behaviour was still plastic in our study, since males were placed into breeding aviaries during early adulthood. Future studies should focus in more detail on how the timing of social experience between early development and first reproduction affects adult behaviour. Also, to understand the functional relevance of the observed effects, reproductive performance should be compared under a range conditions that reflect the changing costs and benefits of sociality and reproductive competition under different densities in the natural environment.";"University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, NRW, Germany"
"Lynne U Sneddon";"Investigating dominance status, aggressiveness and personality in the rainbow trout     (#220)";"Rank position within a dominance hierarchy and the outcome of pair-wise interactions influences the access to valuable resources including food, shelter and mates and influences overall fitness and survival. Rainbow trout form clear, linear dominance hierarchies in groups and also engage in agonistic interactions in pairs. In farmed rainbow trout, aggression may have economic consequences, since repeated agonistic encounters may contribute to the stress levels of the fish and may impact upon welfare. Once dominance is established, dominant individuals show distinct behavioural, physiological and genetic differences to its subordinates and aggression decreases. It is therefore difficult to disentangle the genetic effects of aggression from those of dominance. However, by measuring aggression levels of trout after a single, short encounter, it may be possible to determine a genetic profile of aggression rather than dominance. Advances in sequencing technologies mean that novel candidate genes can be discovered to add to those already known. Moreover, by using shotgun sequencing, the “aggression transcriptome” may be revealed, giving a comprehensive view of evolutionarily important behaviour. This presentation will review research on profiling gene expression in the brains of rank members of dominance hierarchies using a custom built microarray library and exploring gene expression in the brains of winners and losers of dyadic interactions using 454 sequencing alongside hormonal and behavioural measures to determine the genomic correlates of aggressive performance. A number of genes linked to stress and behaviour were identified and further tested in experiments exploring bold, aggressive phenotypes versus shy, timid phenotypes. These genes provide targets for future studies.";"University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom"

In particular, stress in female fish prior to spawn can affect offspring\ncharacteristics after hatch because maternal hormones, mRNA, proteins and\nlipids are deposited into the developing eggs. The glucocorticoid stress\nhormone cortisol is of interest as a mediator of maternal stress on offspring\ncharacteristics because cortisol plays an organizational role during early\ndevelopment in teleost fish. The present study tested the hypothesis that maternal\nexposure to exogenous cortisol prior to spawn affects offspring phenotype by\nhormonal mediation. Adult largemouth bass (Micropterus\nsalmoides) were collected from lakes and distributed into one-acre\nsemi-natural experimental ponds at the Sam Parr Biological Station in Illinois,\nUSA.

After spawn, offspring size, baseline and stress-induced\ncortisol following air exposure, and behaviour (anxiety, exploration, boldness,\nand aggression) at different life-stages were compared between control and\ncortisol-treated mothers. Maternal cortisol treatment did not have a\nsignificant effect on spawning success or timing, but offspring of\ncortisol-treated mothers had higher embryo cortisol levels and mass right after\nhatch, and were less bold and less exploratory.

Whilst\ninvasive fish are often more aggressive at higher temperatures, this could be negated\nat high salinities, depending on osmoregulation.

Obviously, it is not straightforward to disentangle causes and consequences in this interaction. Here, I will review work on the HR-LR (high- and low-responsive) rainbow trout model, initially selected for contrasting post-stress cortisol levels. I will dwell on the observation that LR fish usually show a proactive behavioral pattern and also win contests for social dominance against size-matched HR. This outcome is however context-dependent, with HR fish becoming dominant in a new environment after food restriction and transport.

"Damien R Farine";"Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons     (#226)";"Overcoming conflicts of interest about where to go and what to do is a primary challenge of group-living. The behavioural strategies organisms use to reach consensus decisions are central to understanding the evolution of social complexity. Democratic processes underlie collective dynamics across a wide range of species, but it remains unknown if similar mechanisms apply when groups are strongly stratified. By simultaneously tracking the movements of members of a wild baboon troop using high-resolution GPS telemetry, we show that shared decision-making governs collective movement decisions, even in these socially complex, highly stratified societies. Baboons are more likely to follow when there is strong directional agreement among multiple movement initiators. When initiators propose movement directions that are different, followers compromise by moving in the average of the proposed directions, but only if this difference is small. If the difference between proposed directions exceeds a critical angle, followers move in one direction or the other, and choose based on a majority rule. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly considering the geometry of decision-making in mobile animal groups, and suggest that collective action based on relatively simple rules may be widespread even in complex animal societies. ";"Department of Anthropology, University of California Davis, Davis, Ca, USA"

As part of our ongoing effort to decipher the rules governing locust coordinated behaviour, we used video-recording and cutting-edge movement tracking methods to monitor the marching behaviour of five-instar desert locust nymphs. A group of crowd-reared nymphs in our experimental system spontaneously generated robust and consistent coordinated marching. Using high temporal and spatial resolution analysis, we investigated the early stages and maintenance of this behaviour, from global properties of the swarm, to the movement patterns of individuals and the effective social interaction between conspecifics.  A major feature of the behaviour of individuals within the crowd was intermittent switching between standing and walking, triggered by tactile and/or visual stimuli. This intermittent motion pattern constitute a sequence of individual decisions in which animals repeatedly reassess their situation and their environment, and decide whether or not to swarm. Accordingly, we introduced a new agent-based modelling approach in which pause-and-go motion is pivotal. This interpretation explains several macroscopic observables of the entire swarm, for example, the measured correlation between the order parameter (which quantifies the level of synchronization) and the fraction of walking animals. Theoretically, it implies the existence of generic characteristics in the emergence of collective order in swarms. The suggested instrumental role of visual stimuli was further augmented by neurophysiological experiments showing that the Descending Contralateral Movement Detectors (DCMD, a pair of interneurons instrumental in directing visual sensory inputs to motor centres) are sensitive to stimuli related to approaching and receding walking insects. Furthermore, the DCMD of gregarious animals showed a more adapted response to the visual trigger observed (compared to solitary-reared animals). We are currently further investigating the effects of a changing environment on the behaviour of the individual locusts and the swarm. We are also looking at the marching locusts as inspiration for swarming robots.";"Department of Zoology, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel"

These are sexually dimorphic traits -\nprimarily seen in males- and have evolved with the purpose to attract mates. Sexual\nselection gives rise to traits that aim to maximize reproductive success, often\nat the expense of survival due to the demands it places on the signaler. An\nindividual’s fitness determines how it copes with this cost, leading to\nvariation in strength of sexual signal which females use to choose a mate. In\nrodents, such social information can be relayed by male odors, often via\nurinary cues. A putative candidate for a sexual signal in rats is Major Urinary\nProteins (MUPs) which is a member of the lipocalin family that transports small\nhydrophobic molecules (volatiles). It is secreted in copious amounts in the\nurine which is a common communication mode of rats, making it a good way to\nadvertise sexual fitness. Preliminary work in rats has demonstrated the\nsufficiency and necessity of MUPs to attract females. We show that MUPs mediate\nsexual signaling in a dose dependant manner and we have correlated female\npreference for males with more MUPs. Moreover, a dynamic sexual signal will\nalso be open to manipulation. Parasites are known to exploit such avenues to\nenhance transmission efficiency.

The structure of intelligence and individual cognitive variation have been extensively studied in humans, yet they have received far less attention in non-human animals. In particular, the development of a test battery suitable for quantifying individual cognitive performance in birds remains in its infancy. Additionally, implementing this approach in the wild, where the ecological significance of cognition can also be explored, presents considerable logistical challenges for most species. We developed a cognitive test battery for wild New Zealand North Island robins (Petroica longipes). Our battery was comprised of six tasks based on established measures of avian cognitive performance: a motor task, colour and shape discrimination, reversal learning, spatial memory and inhibitory control. Robins (N = 20) varied greatly in their ability to solve these tasks and we found weakly positive, non-significant correlations between most tasks. A principal components analysis (PCA) of task performances yielded two factors with eigenvalues >1. The first component extracted explained over 34% of the variance in cognitive performance and all six tasks loaded positively on this first component. We show that these results are robust using randomisation tests. Our results thus suggest that a general cognitive factor, analogous to human g, underpins cognitive performance in wild North Island robins tested in their natural habitat. We monitored the reproductive behaviour and output of robins during the 2014-2015 breeding season. General cognitive ability was not predictive of any measures of life-history variation for male robins (N = 13).

Large-scale comparative analyses have revealed that the number of anecdotal reports of novel feeding behaviours increases with relative brain size across both primate and bird taxa. This finding has prompted the suggestion that behavioural flexibility provides a comparative measure of cross-taxon variation in cognitive ability. Yet, to date, the potential role of cognitive mechanisms in innovative behaviour remains speculative. In this paper, I will combine data gathered using the highly successful ecological invader, the common myna, Acridotheres tristis , into a model of how innovative behaviour might be generated with or without the involvement of cognitive processes. Implications for understanding the behavioural and cognitive processes that animals need to adjust to rampant environmental change will be discussed.";"School of Psychology, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"

Reproduction is critical for individual and population success, yet is energetically expensive and is predicted to be adversely affected by ocean acidification in many marine organisms.  We investigated the effects of projected future CO2 levels in the ocean on reproductive output of two species of damselfish, Amphiprion percula and Acanthochromis polyacanthus. Adult breeding pairs were held under three CO2 treatments: current-day control (365 μatm), moderate CO2 (658 μatm), and high CO2 (1023 μatm) for a 7-month period that included the summer breeding season. Reproductive output increased in A. percula, with more pairs breeding and a 30% increase in the number of clutches produced per pair in the high CO2 group. In contrast, A. polyacanthus exhibited a significant decrease in reproductive output, with fewer pairs breeding and a 37% reduction in the number of clutches produced per pair. Despite the variation in reproduction for these two species, neither species showed a difference in parental conditioning between control and high CO2 treatments. Our results demonstrate contrasting impacts of ocean acidification among fish species, even within the same family. A greater understanding of the impacts of ocean acidification on reproductive performance is required to predict the consequences for future populations of marine organisms.";"James Cook University, Douglas, QLD, Australia"

"Angela Crean";"Is it costly for males to maintain fecundity?     (#245)";"Mounting evidence shows that males adaptively alter their\nsperm quality, in addition to sperm quantity, in response to their perceived\nsocial environment and risk of sperm competition. Generally, subordinate males,\nfacing a greater likelihood of sperm competition, produce faster or more motile\nsperm – presumably to make the most of rare mating opportunities when they\narise. Similarly, we would expect males that have been denied access to females\nto invest more in mating at the first opportunity. We tested this idea in the\nneriid fly Telostylinus angusticollis,\nand found that a large proportion of males that had been housed in isolation\ndid not transfer any motile sperm during their first copulation. Moreover,\nfemales were reluctant to mate with these isolated males, kicking their legs to\nprevent males from mounting and mating. In contrast, males that were housed in\nmale-only group cages transferred large amounts of motile sperm in their first\ncopulation, and showed similar mating success to males housed in mixed-sex\ngroup cages. The apparent infertility of isolated males was quickly reversed,\nwith males able to produce viable offspring within 24 hours of female\nintroduction. We speculate that maintaining viable sperm is costly for males,\nand therefore males do not invest in reproductive readiness when they receive\nno social cues indicating the presence of conspecific individuals. The presence\nof other males appears to be a sufficient social cue to induce reproductive\ninvestment. Effects of male social environment on female fecundity and\noffspring quality will be examined to investigate whether this plasticity in\nreproductive investment has adaptive consequences for male reproductive success.";"UNSW Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia"
"Eleanor Bath";"Mating mediates female aggression     (#246)";"Aggression is nearly ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom,\nand plays a major role in determining individual fitness and the evolutionary\ntrajectory of a species. Although most scientific research has focussed on male\naggression, recent work has begun to reveal that aggression by females towards\nother females is common amongst animals, and can have important evolutionary\nconsequences. In the fruit fly, Drosophila\nmelanogaster, both sexes engage in same-sex aggressive behaviour, but\nhistorically research has been heavily biased towards males. However, male and\nfemale intrasexual aggression may differ substantially in contest dynamics,\nlevel of escalation, and reasons to display aggressive behaviour. One avenue in\nwhich sex differences could affect intrasexual aggression is that of mating.\nMales and females differ in their responses to mating – female behaviour and\nphysiology change dramatically after mating in a wide range of taxa, often\nmediated by substances transferred in the male ejaculate. We investigated the\neffects of mating on female aggression in D.\nmelanogaster, and found that mating dramatically increases female\naggressiveness: it induces females to approximately double their time spent in\naggressive encounters. We also found evidence that the seminal fluid protein\n“sex peptide”, which mediates several post mating responses, including\nincreased egg-laying and decreased receptivity, may play a role in increasing\nfemale post-mating aggression. We also tested the effects of egg production on\nfemale post-mating aggressiveness, as theory predicts that individuals with\nhigher resource demands (i.e. mated females producing eggs need high levels of\nprotein) should be more aggressive than those with lower resource demands\n(virgin or mated sterile females). However, our results suggest that feeding,\nfecundity and aggression can be uncoupled. These results suggest that females\nare responding directly to male mating signals in their interactions with other\nfemales, opening up possibilities for sexual conflict or male manipulation of\nfemale-female interactions.";"University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom"
"Yoshitaka Kamimura";"Significance of precise genital coupling for female Drosophila fruit flies: why do females appear to cooperate with males by accepting harmful traumatic matings?     (#247)";"Male\nand female genitalia often exhibit corresponding morphologies indicating\ncoevolutionary processes, but the driving mechanisms of such coevolution are\nstill debated. In Drosophila melanogaster\nand its allied congeners, male　genitalia often bear multiple\nornaments (spines etc.) that inflict wounds on female genitalia during mating. Except\nfor the D. bipectinata species\ncomplex, in which males are known to inject ejaculates into the female vagina through\nwounds, wounds may have unknown functions or may represent a byproduct of secure\nmate-holding. Female genitalia usually bear membranous pouches (‘pockets’) or\nhardened plates at the location where males inflict wounds. Because the soft pockets\ndo not prevent male organs from inflicting wounds, some authors suggest that females\n‘cooperate’ with males by preparing ‘niches’ for the wound-making organs,\ninstead of developing counteradaptations to harmful male behaviors. Here I\nreview studies on Drosophila spp.,\nincluding unpublished ones, to explore whether precisely matched genital\ncouplings reduce mating costs for females. Studies using interspecific crosses or crosses between genetic introgression lines provide evidence that micron-scale differences in male and female genital morphology and resultant mismatches during mating result in an elevated risk of wounding and infection for females. Furthermore, genital mismatches between female D. santomea and male D. yakuba frequently result in failed insertion of the male sperm-transferring organ, leading to leakage of the ejaculate and a prolonged struggle to separate pairs glued together by the ejaculate. Manipulative studies suggest that even small changes in male or female genital morphology (ablation of sensilla or ovipositor tips) strongly affect the latency to mating and insemination success. The dual functions of insect female genitalia, acquisition of sufficient sperm from males (at least one) and oviposition, likely constrain morphological evolution.";"Keio University, Yokohama, KANAGAWA, Japan"

Weights\nand 24 h feeding behaviour (time feeding) were recorded in weeks 1 and 2. Based\non total time spent feeding over a 24 h period in week 1, lambs were\ncategorized into two distinct groups: “Shy-feeders” (<30 min feeding, n=19)\nand “Feeders” (>1 hour feeding, n=101).

However, despite this trait being a product of an interaction\nbetween two or more individuals, the effect of social partners on the focal\nindividual’s phenotype has been neglected. In contests, the opponent is a key\ndeterminant an individual’s behavioural decisions, because individuals adjust\ntheir plastic response to the different phenotypes they confront. The presence\nof between individual variation (‘personalities’) in the social environment\ntherefore holds important evolutionary consequences because phenotypes of\nsocial partners are expression of their genotypes, and thus can evolve. Here we investigated how within\nindividual variation (plasticity) in aggression is affected by the personalities\nin the social environment with novel variance partitioning tools available from\nthe field of quantitative genetics. We repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught\nadult male Field crickets gryllus\ncampestris in staged fights, measuring aggressive phenotypes on both\npartners. Furthermore, by repeatedly measuring other personality traits in\nnon-social contexts such as activity and exploration, we explicitly investigated\nwhich repeatable phenotypes of the social partners affect aggression.

Interestingly, more explorative individuals elicited consistently higher aggression in their social\npartners (r = 0.45), suggesting that the plastic response in aggression of\nthe social partners depends in part on the exploratory behavioural type of the\nother interacting individual.

However, elevated testosterone does inhibit paternal\ncare of young, similar to high latitude species. In low elevation populations\nof the wire-tailed manakins, Pipra\nfilicauda, territorial males on leks display higher testosterone than\nfloaters but also cooperate with these floaters in an effort to attract females.\nThus elevated testosterone is associated more with cooperation than aggression.\nIt is clear that testosterone’s behavioral role in these equatorial birds\ncontradicts much of what we understand about the hormone based on studies of\nhigh latitude species. Our future studies of these species and other tropical\nbirds will continue to elucidate and expand our understanding of the behavioral\nrole of testosterone.";"Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States"
"Erik Wapstra";"Repeatable intra-individual variation in Testosterone and sex sex-specific links to aggressive personalities in a social lizard, Egernia whitii     (#269)";"Individual\nhormone profiles can be important generators of phenotypic variation. Despite\nthis, work on the consequences of hormone profiles has traditionally ignored inter-individual\nvariation within natural populations. A key advance is to examine repeatability\nin hormone profiles and their links to behavioral traits under selection. We firstly\nshow that individuals within a free-ranging population of the Australian lizard\nEgernia whitii exhibit temporal repeatability in their testosterone\nconcentrations as well as their aggressive responses towards conspecific\nintruders. There were significant, sex-specific links between testosterone and\naggression; testosterone and aggression was negatively linked in males, while\nthere is no relationship in females. As conspecific aggression has significant\nconsequences for fitness-related traits (parental care, mating strategies) in\nthis species, inter-individual variation in testosterone concentrations,\nthrough their effects on aggression, could have important implications for\nindividual fitness. In the second part of this study, we conducted two\ncomplementary experiments designed to investigate the activational relationship\nbetween testosterone and aggression in male lizards. First, we investigated whether a conspecific aggressive challenge\ninduced a testosterone response and second, we artificially manipulated testosterone\nconcentrations to examine whether this changed aggression levels. Testosterone\nconcentrations were not influenced by an aggression challenge. However, there\nwas a slight indication that receiving a challenge may influence\nintra-individual consistency of testosterone, with individuals not receiving an\naggression challenge maintaining consistency in their circulating testosterone\nconcentrations, while those individuals that received a challenge did not. Our\nstudy adds increasing evidence that the relationship between testosterone and\naggression is not straightforward, and promotes the investigation of alternative\nhormonal pathways and differences\nin neuro-synthesis and neuroendocrine pathways to account for species variable\ntestosterone – aggression links.";"University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia"

We studied the homing behavior of two territorial poison frog species in the field using telemetry. We revealed that males of Ameerega trvittata return to their home territory via a direct path after experimental translocations of up to 800 m. We also found that a small dendrobatid frog Allobates femoralis relies on experience to find the way home from up to 400 m. Taken together, our results suggest that poison frogs form a spatial map of a large area but the exact landmarks being used remain unknown.

"Rebecca Turner";"Insights into the navigation mechanisms of the homing pigeon (Columba livia): a geo-spatial and individual-based modelling approach     (#602)";"Despite decades of pigeon homing research, little is known about how navigational decisions are formed explicitly. Here, we first investigate whether regional patterns of initial orientation errors (IOEs) of homing pigeons are associated with spatial variation in environmental factors. We used data obtained from two previous pigeon-orientation studies in New York State, USA (1975) and Frankfurt, Germany (1992). These data were re-analysed using modern geospatial modelling techniques. Preliminary results show IOE patterns are anisotropic and highly correlated with the spatial structure of geomagnetic field (compared to other environmental stimuli such as topography, gravity intensity, and wind patterns). This provides indirect but strong evidence that geomagnetic parameters play an important role in the pigeon’s map sense. Secondly, based on our findings, we propose a ‘virtual lab’ approach to test the following two hypothesis using individual-based simulation models (IBSMs): 1) Pigeons rely on systematically varied stimuli for navigation; 2) IOE is a result of interactions between perception of the bird and anomalies of the environmental cues. In our IBSMs, both organisms and the environments they interact with will be simulated in an artificial platform (or in silico). Each simulation will test a trait of the animal or the environment, or a combination of traits, and assess their contribution to the observed IOE pattern quantitatively. This research will provide insights into homing behaviours, which will serve as a stepping stone for understanding navigation mechanisms.";"School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland"

During January-March 2015 we satellite tagged 13 whales\n(5 with depth/location and 8 with location-only transmitters; Wildlife\nComputers) in the Bonney Upwelling region. The tags and the deployment method\nwere those previously refined by the Australian Antarctic Division (Double et\nal. 2014), and data are collected using the Argos system. Whales were\nphoto-identified and also biopsied to determine sex and confirm subspecies. Up\nto the date of submission of this abstract, tags transmitted from a range of 11\nhours to 49 days. Whales performed square-, U- and V-shape dives, dived to a\nmaximum of 483 m, and for a maximum of 51 min. Whale movements ranged from\neastern South Australia, over the continental shelf south of Kangaroo Island,\nto between mainland Australia and Tasmania. The distance travelled ranged from\n86km for the tag that transmitted for 11 hrs, to 4438km for a tag that\ntransmitted for 48 days and 13 hrs. Most whales remained for the majority of\ntheir time over the continental shelf in the area of the Bonney Upwelling with\nsome movements to the continental slope. Additional data analyses will involve\ncomparing whale tracks with environmental variables (sea surface temperature\nand chlorophyll a), using these tracks to infer behavioural states using state-space\nmodels, and potentially determining the northward migratory route of the whales\nusing this feeding area.

A theoretically elegant, but as yet\nuntested, way of delineating the skyline is to use the maximum difference in\nthe ratio of green wavelengths of light to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths to\ndefine where the tops of terrestrial objects are. Terrestrial objects generally\nreflect relatively more green wavelengths while the sky contains relatively\nmore UV wavelengths. Using a ratio in opponent-process fashion gains constancy\nin the face of changes in overall illumination level. We tested the use of UV\nwavelengths in homing ants by using a clear plastic that blocked wavelengths\nbelow 400 nm completely. Desert ants, Melophorus bagoti, were trained to home repeatedly from the middle of\na uniformly coloured arena providing an artificial skyline (Experiment 1) or\nunder natural conditions with the natural panorama (Experiment 2). On a test,\nan ant was allowed to run home, but was captured just before she entered their\nnest. Such a zero-vector ant was then brought back to the middle of a replicate\narena (Experiment 1) or the starting point (the feeder, Experiment 2) and\nreleased for a test. Blocking UV light led to deteriorations in orientation in\nboth experiments. If the artificial skyline was transformed from opaque to\ntransparent UV-blocking plastic (Experiment 3) on the other hand, the ants were\nstill oriented.

"Parrish Brady";"Polarized Patterns in the Forest Canopy and Undergrowth     (#606)";"Polarization patterns are produced by the scattering of light off of various forms of matter and are therefore both ubiquitous in natural environments and information rich. As such, the study of polarization vision, signaling, and camouflage are important topics in ecology.  However, unlike other environments with highly structured polarization patterns (e.g. the open ocean), little quantitative work has been done to characterize the polarization environments of forest canopies.  Understanding the structure of polarization patterns in the forest canopy can inform how polarization sensitive animals manage their polarization contrast with the background and potentially navigate in that environment. To measure polarization patterns in the canopy we use a custom division of time full stokes polarimeter and data logging compass and inclinometer.  This allows simultaneous measurements of the polarization signatures from vegetation and animals with the accompanying environmental angular information.  The light field structure surrounding the objects is also measured.   Simulations were developed to use the solar elevation compass and inclinometer data, ray tracing techniques, and Fresnel reflection physics to compare measured and simulated components of the vegetative polarization light field.  In direct sunlight the vegetative polarization patterns predictively follow the relative position of the sun.  But within the canopy and the forest floor where there is little direct sunlight or during cloudy conditions the polarization patterns, while still very significant, are much harder to predict. The polarization patterns in these environments are determined by the brightest sources of light and their respective solid angle.  We measure three test subjects (lepidoptera, odonata, and scarabidae) in situ for contrasting measures in these environments.  We find that the lepidoptera and odonata tested had contrasting degree of linear polarization but similar angle of linear polarization to the environment.  Scarab reflections showed contrasting angle of linear polarization with similar degree of linear polarization. ";"University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX-TEXAS, United States"
"Shohei G Tsujimoto";"Effect of the third flowers on the avoidance learning of deceptive flowers by bumble bees.     (#607)";"Some plant species produce deceptive flowers that attract pollinators without rewarding by mimicking rewarding flowers. Understanding the factors that affect the success of “deceptive flowers” and the suffering of “model flowers” are important to consider the conditions of their coexistence and the evolution of deceptive flower . It has been discussed that success of deceptive flowers depends on similarity to their model flowers and their density in the community. However, other factors that affect leaning of pollinators could also affect the success of deceptive flowers. In the field with several interspersed plant species in bloom, “third flowers” that coexist with deceptive and model flowers may also affect the learning. Here, we examined the effect of “third flower” on the learning of bumble bees by using artificial flowers: model rewarding flowers (Blue: Model), two types of non-rewarding flowers that differ in color similarity to the model (Sky-blue and Ink-blue: Mimics), and rewarding flowers that remarkably differ in color (Yellow: Outsider). Based on the bee color hexagon (Chittka et al. 1992: J Comp Physiol), color distance between Sky-blue and Blue is 0.058, and Ink-blue and Blue is 0.124, respectively. When bees foraged in the mixed array of Model and Mimic (Sky-blue or Ink-blue) flowers, they learned to avoid Mimic with their experience. However, in the array of Model, Mimic and Outsider, bees almost did not avoid Mimic even after they gained experience, when the color of the Mimic was Sky-blue. When the color of the Mimic was Ink-blue, bees learned to avoid Mimic independent of the existence of Outsider. In the array of Model and Outsider, bees equally visited both types of flower. Our results suggest that the third flower could affect the learning of deceptive flowers by bumble bees, while its effect may depend on similarity between deceptive and model flowers.";"University of Toyama, Toyama, TOYAMA, Japan"

(#608)";"A large number of behavioural models of cognition and emotion in rodents rely on food motivation, which could be affected in models of obesity. Our objective was therefore to evaluate the applicability for long-term interventions in rats of a previously known ethologically relevant test1 , able to pick up subtle cognitive impairments, with test parameters independent of food motivation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=18) were water-deprived (20 hours) prior to training in a lever-based water reward task in a modified Skinner box (Fixed Ratio = 1). Following the Optimal Foraging theory, an element of uncertainty was introduced: 90% probability of a reward being yielded combined with a 20% probability of system shut down. Reactivation required rats to break a distant photobeam. Thus, the rats had to estimate when relocating to reactivate the system was feasible. Following training, the mean number of lever presses in an OFF sequence could be organised in decision curves, stable over time (n=12, no significant difference between test sessions). Animals could be classified into 'fast' (n=15, mean 3, SD 1.5), 'slow' (n=2, mean 10, SD 1) and 'non-learners' (n=1, excluded from study) depending on how many sessions they took to reach criterion. This classification did not influence performance after reaching criterion (n=17, no significant difference in number of rewards obtained between test sessions). After reaching criterion, the animals (n=12) were tested at 3 weeks of distance, without evidencing variations in performance and decision rule (P > 0.05). A subset of the animals (n=6) was then tested 3 additional times, spaced 3 weeks from each other, and no significant difference in decision rules was observed (P > 0.05). This preliminary trial shows the integrity of the Decision Making paradigm for cognitive testing in the context of long-term studies (up to 9 weeks after reaching criterion) involving dietary or pharmacological interventions.";"University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg C, HOVESTADEN, Denmark"

In costly situations, most vertebrates (and\neven certain invertebrates) tend to preferentially use a certain side\nof their body (e.g. hand, foot, eye) to manipulate or get information\nfrom an object or their environment (i.e. laterality).

Human participants typically need to categorize the color of a word or of a frame around an image. Latencies to identify the color are typically slowed down when the emotional valence of the word or image is negative rather than neutral (emotional Stroop effect). Here we investigated whether a similar effect could be found in chimpanzees. Six chimpanzees were trained on a touch screen task to choose, based on color, between two simultaneously presented stimuli. The stimuli on each trial were differently colored frames that contained identical images. After a training phase subjects were presented with four different categories of novel images: three categories of photographs of humans whose relationship with the subject differed across categories (veterinarian, stranger, caretaker), and control stimuli showing merely a white square. Because visits by the veterinarian are stressful to most subjects, we expected subjects to select the correct color less accurately and more slowly when the embedded picture depicted the zoo veterinarian than with any other stimulus category. For the first session, we found color selection to be indeed slower for trials presenting the veterinarian. Moreover, this effect was more pronounced for subjects whose last anaesthetization experience was more recent, indicating that emotional valence associated with the stimuli caused the slowdown. We propose our modified emotional Stroop task as a simple method to explore how emotional stimuli affect cognitive performance in nonhuman primates.";"Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, SAXONY ANHALT, Germany"

During training trials, the subject was presented with five items (color photographs) in random locations on a black background on a touch screen. If the items were touched in correct order, the subject was rewarded, if any item was touched too early, the subject was not rewarded and instead, there was a timeout. In the testing phase, the subject was presented with regular trials (identical to training trials), as well as memory trials. Memory trials were presented on a white (rather than black) background and correctly touching the first item of the list resulted in the remaining items being covered by checkerboard patterns for the rest of the trial. During the test phase the subject received both regular and memory trials with three, four and five items. In line with the idea that chimpanzees exert metacognitive control, we expected the subject to show longer latencies (study time) before touching the first item in memory trials than in regular trials.

"Lynna Feng";"Dogs as a Unique Model for Understanding Visual Perception     (#613)";"Visual illusions provide a unique perspective into the role of the brain in the perceptual organization of visual stimuli, especially since the susceptibility to illusions varies between children, individuals with autism, and individuals from remote cultures. The mechanisms underlying these misperceptions are widely debated, but thought to be related to assimilation versus contrast effects, local versus global processing, or learned interpretations of perspective. Various animal species have also been found to be differently susceptible to visual illusions and have subsequently been investigated as models for understanding the differences in humans. In this study, we present dogs as a model for investigating differences in susceptibility to visual illusions within a single species. The extensive selective breeding of dogs from sight hounds bred for their visual abilities, to scent hounds bred for their olfactory abilities, to breeds bred for their visual appeal, has resulted in a wide range in behaviours and morphologies. It is reasonable to suggest that these behavioural and physical differences impact the dogs’ visual perceptions. For example, brachycephalic dogs have been shown to have a different distribution of ganglion cell density and more pronounced area centralis (McGreevy, Grassi, & Harman 2004), suggesting that they might perceive the world differently than dogs with longer noses. As such, dogs present a unique opportunity due to the vast within-species variation across breeds. This preliminary study looks at susceptibility of dogs to four common size-related visual illusions: the Ebbinghaus-Titchener (or Ebbinghaus) illusion, the Delboeuf illusion, the Müller-Lyer illusion, and the Ponzo illusion.

This is a first step in using the treadmill as a new paradigm for the study of sociality and cooperation with the long terms goals of (1) measuring potential benefits of joint running, (2) staging experiments on social hunting, and (3) studying domestication effects. \tFive different steps were used to train 4 wolves (Canis lupus occidentalis) and 4 mongrel dogs (Canis lupus familiaris): habituation sessions with treadmill switched (1) off and then (2) on (0.5 km/h), target training (target used to support stepping on treadmill) with the treadmill switched (3) off and then (4) on (also increasing speed), and (5) staying on the treadmill at least 5 seconds at a speed of 4.5 km/h. Heart rate (HR) parameters (e.g. average HR and RMSSD; von Borell et al., 2007), measured by the non-invasive Polar RS800CX monitor, were used to assess the stress response of the wolves and equally raised and kept dogs.\tDogs needed longer to master the different training steps than wolves (p = 0.03). This was surprising, because we expected wolves to be more neophobic than dogs and, hence, to have greater difficulties with our task. When comparing dog RMSSD between the training steps a trend was found (p = 0.07) towards higher RMSSD values (relaxation) in the target training phases. Also, dogs were more relaxed than wolves in the target training phase with the treadmill on (p = 0.03). It seems that the human presence specifically relaxes the dogs during target training, although it still took them longer than wolves to master using treadmill.

We used three main lines of approach: 1) anatomical studies of the\nretina, including calculations of visual acuity; 2) transcriptomics using\nRNA-Seq to study visual opsin expression; 3) microspectrophotometry (MSP) to\nidentify the spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors.Our\nresults show that all three coral reef fish predators have at least two types\nof cone cells: double or twin cones and single cones. All three are also likely\nto be dichromatic with at least two types of spectrally distinct photoreceptors\n(in addition to rod cells). The coral trout and scorpionfish express mainly\nRH2A and SWS2A opsins, while the slingjaw wrasse expresses mainly LWS and RH2A\nopsins, while also expressing SWS2B (but no SWS2A expression).As\nwith other coral reef fish, the distribution of photoreceptors in all three\npredators is highest within a horizontal band stretching naso-temporally across\nthe middle of the retina. The coral trout and slingjaw wrasse were found to\nhave a higher visual acuity than the scorpionfish and are able to distinguish 2\nmm and 1 mm stripes at a distance of 1 m respectively.

In northern pig-tailed macaque, juveniles move their tail as\nthey jump around branches to take balances.

"Takashi Haramura";"Hatching plasticity in response to salinity levels in a rhacophorid frog, Buergeria japonica     (#628)";"Embryos within egg capsules often suffer mortality risk from abiotic and biotic factors, and embryos have a few options available for their defense. Altering timing of hatching is one of the defensive behaviour against egg mortality risk. However, inappropriate hatching timing such as early hatching may incur a cost. Therefore, embryos within egg capsules need accurate information about their egg-mortality risk to adjust their hatching timing. To examine whether embryos adjust hatching timing in response to egg mortality risk, I exposed embryos within egg capsules of a frog, Buergeria japonica, to different salinity levels. Salinity is a major mortality risk for amphibian eggs, and eggs of this frog are exposed to unexpected salinity fluctuation because spawning occurs in coastal areas. When exposed to high salinity, embryos of B. japonica hatched earlier than those exposed to low salinity. Especially, when transferred to salinity levels of 5‰ or more, embryos hatched almost immediately. Hatchings that emerged earlier showed small body size, earlier developmental stage, and low swimming performance. The present study demonstrated that salinity is one of triggers that induce early hatching in amphibians, and embryos of B. japonica adjust hatching timing based on salinity differences accordingly.";"Kyoto University, Shirahama, WAKAYAMA, Japan"

Two female African elephants (matriarchs of the herd) were implanted with actiwatches in their trunk and fitted with a collar that measured: (1) their location via GPS, and (2) whether they were standing or lying down, each minute for a period of 6 weeks. Additionally, 10 environmental parameters were measured with a portable weather station. We found that on average, each elephant slept for 2.1 hours per day. Sleep was polyphasic, but the major sleep bout occurred between 3 – 6 am. Interestingly, on nights when the moon was full, the elephants did not sleep, staying awake for up to 48 hours continuously, while on nights of the new moon, the elephants slept for up to 6 hours. While sleep onset time was variable, sleep offset times regularly occurred a few minutes prior to the coldest part of the day. Thus, both light and temperature affect sleep in the wild elephants. The total sleep time is the lowest recorded sleep times of all mammals, presumably to allow the elephants to obtain enough nutrition. Studies of the brain reveal that the arousal system is specialized in two locations, the orexinergic neurons of the hypothalamus and the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus. Thus, being able to stay awake long enough to obtain enough nutrition, is correlated with specializations of two parts of the neuronal arousal systems.";"University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, ACT, South Africa"

This head-bobbing is one of the most striking\nfeatures of avian locomotion. It has been two functional implications about\nthis movement: visual and postural stabilization. This study examined whether\nhead bobbing in chickens (Gallus gallus\ndomesticus) is controlled by walking itself or visual motion accompanied\nwith walking using treadmill apparatus.Six chickens\nwere trained to walk on a treadmill. Two LCD monitors were arranged on both\nsides of the treadmill. While the chicken walked with the various treadmill\nspeed, random dots moving to the same direction as the treadmill were presented\non the lateral monitors. The chicken’s head position was recorded from above\nthe apparatus using a video camera and traced by originally developed object\ntracking system. We found that (1) backward head movements occurred with\npresentation of backward motion stimulus, (2) no consistent movements occurred\nwith presentation of static stimulus, (3) the velocity of head movements was\nsignificantly correlated with the velocity of dots, and (4) walking speed had\nlittle effect on velocity or frequency of head movements. These results indicate\nthat head-bobbing in chickens is tuned to visual motion velocity, not walking\nspeed. Further experiment revealed that the head movements were affected by\nfrontal expanding stimuli, suggesting that head-bobbing is elicited by global\nmotions or optical flow, not by local motions.The present study suggests that visual\nstabilization is the dominant function of head-bobbing and postural\nstabilization is secondarily adapted. This head movements is analogous to\noptokinetic response with eyes in humans and other mammals. Comparing head and\neye stabilization should reveal their phylogenetic origins and explain\ndifferences of required visual cognitive ability in each species.";"Department of Psychology, Graduate School of Letters, Kyoto University, Sakyo, KYOTO, Japan"

The treatment had significant effect on the change of percentage of steatocrit. Faecal fat content increased in all birds in the infected group, except for one bird. The results indicate that parasites impaired the organism's ability to absorb fat from the dietary intake. The underlying mechanisms might be tissue damage caused by parasites or host's immune response. Previously it has been shown that parasites infections decreases carotenoid levels in plasma and feathers which suggest carotenoid malabsorption.

Marching swarms of desert locust nymphs offer an ideal model to pursue this specific question, as they are highly interactive with the topography of the environment in which they march.  We monitored the movement of crowd-reared five-instar nymphs in a ring-shaped arena. We then indented a portion of the ring to create a converging or diverging funnel that affected the movement of the animals, and compared the coordinated behaviors between different types of arenas (symmetric vs . asymmetric with different funnel sizes) .Â Using high temporal and spatial resolution analysis, we analyzed individual trajectories in order to obtain the impact of topography on the movement patterns of individuals and on the global properties of the swarm. Irrespective of the specific topography tested, the locusts demonstrated consistent coordinated marching. Moreover, we found a correlation between the order parameter (which quantifies the level of synchronization) and the marching speed. Â These findings add to a previously reported correlation with the fraction of walking animals. Other characteristics of individual behavior, such as the duration of walking bouts, were also affected.  Future work is aimed at modeling locust behavior under changing environmental topographies.

"Tomoko Sakiyama";"Deviated Trail-Laying Behavior Stemmed from Directional Interaction     (#647)";"Foraging ants use chemical pheromones for recruiting their nest-mates. If agents simply obey this information absolutely, the balance between exploitation and exploration appears to be never achieved. However, actual foragers seem to maintain this balance on individual level. Desert ants appear to achieve deviated movements when their outbound foraging by using visual landmarks combined with path integration (Bolek & Wolf, 2015). These deviated movements might encourage agents to explore near sites while exploiting experienced food sites. Chemical pheromones as social information wouldn't offer agents concrete directional information. Rather, ambiguous directions can be produced if agents consider global properties of chemical information. In this paper therefore we assume that agents in our model consider the relationship between chemical information and moving information of others as concrete directional information. We developed a multi-agent model in which agents reacted to chemical pheromones\nor directional information of local others in order to form trail-laying\nbehaviors as social swarms. Agents in our model adopted one strategy\n(pheromones or directions) and switched these two strategies. Switching behaviors are dependent on environmental contexts. Agents showed curvatures while moving forward as a result. However, this simple switching model couldn't\nexplain deviated route-choices when agents were forced to explore\nbinary-branch routes.

Induced initiations are experimentally provoked within a\nprotocol where only the tested horse is informed of the location of hidden food\n(4 initiations/horse). Experimental approach has two main assets since it allows\n1/ inducing initiations in all horses even though some of them do not initiate\nspontaneously; 2/ limiting the possibility of the initiator’s recruitment (no\npre-departure period) and thus focusing only on the influence of the initiator’s\nidentity on its success. Comparing success levels between spontaneous and\nexperimental contexts will allow us to settle between two hypotheses. If the\ninitiator’s identity plays a major role in its success, success levels should\nbe similar between spontaneous and experimental contexts. On the contrary, if\nother mechanisms are significantly involved, success levels should differ\nbetween contexts. Developing such an experimental approach in complex groups of\nmammals opens up new perspectives to determine which factors, either individual\nor anonymous, are determinant for moving collectively.";"UMR7178 DEPE, IPHC, CNRS, Strasbourg"
"Anuradha Batabyal";"Urban lizards run faster and have bolder escape strategies     (#650)";"Escape theory predicts that animals\nassess and respond to potential threats based on the costs and benefits\nassociated with the response. As a result, many studies find that flight\ninitiation distance (FID) of a prey varies as a function of the level of threat\n(e.g. predator size, speed, directness of approach) and the context (e.g.\nmicrohabitat, available refuges).   With\nrapid habitat modification due to urbanization, both the threats and environmental\ncontext for lizards are changing, often during the lifetime of the individual,\nresulting in a need to flexibly modify escape strategies. Here, we examine\ninter-population differences in escape responses and sprint speed of the rock\nagama Psammophilus dorsalis across an\nurban-rural gradient. By simulating predator attacks by an approaching observer\nin the field, we found several key differences in escape strategies between\nareas that differ in level of anthropogenic disturbance (low or high anthropogenic\ndisturbance, or rural). Males from high anthropogenic disturbance areas had\nsignificantly shorter FIDs followed by males from low anthropogenic disturbance\nsites. Rural males had the longest FIDs as the refuge distances and habituation\nto humans differed across this gradient. From laboratory trials on a racetrack,\nwe found that the sprint speed of urban (high and low anthropogenic\ndisturbance) males were significantly faster than rural males. By contrast,\nescape strategies of females were similar across the urban-rural gradients,\nmost likely because females show cryptic coloration and typically remain\nstationary when approached. In conclusion, urbanization is altering escape\nstrategies of the larger and more conspicuous males, rather than the cryptic\nfemales of P. dorsalis. . In urban\nhabitats, habituation to general and nonlethal disturbance can be an effective\nstrategy, and thus shorter FIDs might be beneficial, especially since these\nurban males from high anthropogenic disturbance areas are faster and have\ncloser refuges.";"Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, KARNATAKA, India"

We found that smaller tadpoles tended to\nrely on immobility in response to tactile stimulation, whereas larger tadpoles\ntended to respond with a burst of movement, consistent with economic\npredictions. It was also found that distance swum in response to a threat does\nnot correlate with tadpole size, but varies between individual sites. This may\nindicate that where a movement response was elicited, it is not intended to put\na greater distance between prey and predator, but to break free from a\npotential predator. Utilization of crypsis was not unequivocally demonstrated,\nbut cannot be discounted as a predator avoidance tactic in these habitats.

However, few\nstudies have revealed heterospecific eavesdropping by non-vocal animals. Most\nspecies of lizards, except for Gekkota, do not vocalize, but neurophysiological\nstudies have revealed that most lizard groups possess well-developed ears.

To examine this hypothesis we utilized three malagasy\nlizards: the Madagascan giant day gecko, Phelsuma\nkochi, the Madagascan spiny-tailed iguana, Oplurus cuvieri, and a wide-tailed zonosaur, Zonosaurus laticaudatus.

We experimentally tested\nwhether these lizards discriminate alarm calls of a syntopic passerine bird, Terpsiphone mutata, from its songs. We\nplayed back alarm calls and songs of the bird to wild lizards and recorded\ntheir responses with a video camcorder. The analyses of the video records\nshowed that P. kochi changed\nits body color quicker and darker, O.\ncuvieri exhibited vigilance behaviors more frequently, and Z. laticaudatus stopped foraging longer,\nin response to the alarm calls than the songs. These results demonstrate that\nthe three lizard species have the ability to discriminate the avian alarm calls\nfrom the songs.

"Daiqin Li";"Visual and chemical masquerade in a bird dropping crab spider: predator avoidance and prey attraction     (#653)";"A masquerading animal evolves to closely resemble inedible\nand generally inanimate objects such as bird droppings to avoid predation by\nbeing misidentified as inedible objects by its predators and/or gain access to\nprey by not correctly identified as innocuous objects by its prey. Almost all\nprevious theoretical and empirical studies have exclusively focused on visual\nmasquerade, in which the animal’s body colour, size and shape mimic an\ninanimate object. Here we provide the first evidence of both visual and chemical\nmasquerade in animals. The crab spiders of the genus Phrynarachne not only visually resemble a typical bird dropping in\ncolour, size and shape, they are also smelled like bird droppings. Yet this\nnotion remains untested. We hypothesized that the bird dropping crab spiders\nresemble bird dropping not only visually but also chemically to repel predators\nand also attract prey. We tested this hypothesis by using visual modeling and\nby performing behavioural assays using Portia\nsp. as predators and houseflies (Musca\ndomestica) as prey. We provided the first empirical evidence that like bird\ndroppings, either visual, volatile chemical cues emitted from P. ceylonica’s body and silk alone or\nboth repelled significantly more Portia\nand attracted significantly more flies compared to the controls. Accordingly,\nwe concluded that P. ceylonica forms\na visual and chemical masquerade that resembles bird droppings, thus reducing\npredation risk and at the same time increasing foraging success.";"Centre for Behavioural Ecology & Evolution, College of Life Sciences, Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"
"Mizuho Suzuki";"The changes of hesitation behavior of “easy-going” hoverfly when attacked suddenly by ambush spider.     (#654)";"Hoverflies possess several antipredator adaptations that minimize predation risk during foraging. Some species of Syrphinae shows ‘hesitation behaviour’ after approaching flower. They moves backwards and forwards in front of a flower before landing. This behavior have been said as antipredator adaptations of hoverflies to avoid ambush by crab spiders. Such hesitation behavior may enable to elicit a crab spider on the flower to attack, resulting in the decrease of the predation risk. However, there may be few number of hoverflies that show the hesitation behavior in the habitat without crab spider. Field experiments were conducted to investigate whether the number of hesitation behavior of Sphaerophoria indiana changes after they were artificially attacked as if predators landed on flower. The number of hesitation behavior was counted in the grassland where Erigeron annus was dominant with a lot of flower, that was visited by hoverflies. The number of hesitation behavior of S. indiana was almost zero in habitat. During foraging on the flower, we picked strongly, but not killing, an abdomen of each individual up with tweezers once and counted the number of hesitation at following visit of the flower. Although the number of hesitation behavior did not change after they were attacked, the number of hoverflies that reject to the next flower increased. Hoverflies in the habitat where crab spider is absent did not show hesitation behavior, but they reject flower after they experienced artificially attack. Hoverflies could know the presence of ambush predator by attacker once, but they do not change the number of hesitation behavior immediately. Hesitation behavior of hoverflies could be used to evaluate information on the flower such as flower resources.";"College of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba"

(#656)";"Behavioural profiles are shaped during ontogeny - the time from the\nmoment the egg is fertilized until the death of an individual. To increase\ntheir fitness, subjects have to adjust themselves to their abiotic as well as to\ntheir biotic environment. The latter does not only consist of inter- but also\nintraspecies interactions which can be defined as social environment. The\nsocial environment can support welfare and health. However, it can also result\nin severe stress, eventually leading to diseases and even death. Thus, the\nsocial environment represents a most influential stressor, which, during\npregnancy, can even be crucial for the development of the offspring as well.\nFor example in wild cavies, instability of the social environment during\npregnancy and lactation affects the development of the offspring: Daughters of\nmothers living in an unstable social environment exhibit a profound behavioural\nmasculinization in contrast to daughters of mothers which had lived in a stable\nsocial environment [1]. In the present study, we\ninvestigated whether daughters of mothers living in unstable social environments\nhave advantages over daughters of mothers living in stable social environments\nin situations where resources are scarce. The idea of this experiment is that\nhigh population density situations are characterized by a high degree of\ninstability and scarce resources, whereas low population density situations are\ncharacterized by a high degree of stability and sufficient resources. Thus, in\nsituations in which resources are limited, competitive abilities are important\nand masculine traits facilitate the attainment of dominant social positions\nwhich in turn help to secure resources more efficiently. Under such conditions\nmasculinized females might fare better than non-masculinized ones. We analysed cortisol\nreactivity, body weight development and dominance establishment and will\ndiscuss whether the different behavioural phenotypes are caused by maternal\neffects and may represent adaptations to prevailing and future environmental\nconditions.

Using a grimace scale validated for sheep (Guesgen 2014), 64, Merino lambs were assessed for pain following surgical and tail-docking (marking). Demeanour of the nose, mouth, cheek, eyes and ear posture were scored on a 3 point scale, and values combined to calculate an overall 0 (no pain) to 2 (obvious) result. Lambs were randomly allocated to 4 treatment groups: Sham (S); marking, no pain relief (C); marking, flunixin in feed (4.0mg/kg) at 24 h and 1 h prior to marking (F); and marking, flunixin injected (2.0mg/kg) 1 h prior to marking (I). Lambs were recorded, in their pens (free) and when restrained (held) at 0, 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h relative to marking. For analysis the scores given for each facial unit were averaged to give an overall score. Ears were not included as they could not be scored with confidence. Data at time 0 h were analysed by Chi-square test and data post-marking were analysed as proportions using a binomial test. Prior to marking, there was a significant association between free vs. held and incorrect pain assessment χ2 (1) = 12.70, P<0.001, with 62% of held lambs and 18% of free of free lambs incorrectly identified. Post-marking, a free vs. held effect (P=0.03) and treatment effect (P<0.001) were observed. Held C lambs were classified as in pain more often than held S and I lambs (P<0.05). Free C lambs were scored as in pain more often than free S, F and I lambs (P<0.05 for all). S lambs were scored as in pain less often than I and F lambs (P<0.05) A lack of different ear postures was found, perhaps due to lambs orienting to the observer. Hollowing of cheeks were infrequently observed, possibly due to lambs having wrinkled, woolly faces. The grimace scale shows potential as a rapid and practical method to assess pain in lambs, but lambs should be observed without interference, as restraint may change aspects of facial expression. ";"CSIRO, Armidale, NSW, Australia"

However, behavioural indicators of pain in goat kids\nmust be validated first. The key aim of this research was to identify kid\nactivities that are indicative of pain associated with disbudding.

Animals were video recorded\n12 h pre- and post-treatment in the home pen and one trained observer\nsystematically counted all occurrences of 11 different behaviours. The change\nin activity frequency (post- minus pre-treatment) was compared between treatment\ngroups. CAUT and SHAM kids performed\nthe same behaviours before and after treatment. Both treatments displayed\nhigher (P≤0.05)\nfrequencies of the observed behaviours post-treatment; however CAUT treated\nkids showed an even greater increase (with one exception, body shaking, which decreased).\nBehaviours (mean±SEM) that had the greatest change in response\nto disbudding were: body shaking (6.1±0.4 vs. 8.8±0.5,\nCAUT and SHAM, respectively; P<0.025), head shaking (31.2±3.1 vs. 17.5±1.8, CAUT and SHAM, respectively; P<0.030), head rubbing (42±0.8 vs. 0.8±0.3, CAUT and SHAM, respectively; P<0.020) and head scratching (15.8±5.9 vs. 2.2±1.1, CAUT and SHAM, respectively; P<0.045).

The way elephants are kept varies: some live in large tracts of land and are lured by high-energy food rewards to come in for interactions, others are stabled in pens and/or buildings for part of the day and are herded to the bush to forage for the remaining non-show/interaction time. They are usually managed as a group or divided into two or more smaller groups, if problems of compatibility arise. However, the smaller groups are usually stabled in the same facility, one near the other (e.g., in adjacent pens). Wild African savannah elephants form social groups called families, composed by related females and their offspring1 . Different families can coalesce and split in a fission-fusion society. Pubertal (9-18 years) male elephants gradually (during up to 4 years) leave their natal group, becomingÂ solitary or associating among them away from their natal range. They associate with females when in musth for reproduction.  The aim of the study was to investigate captive elephant groupsâ composition. We gathered data concerning 49 elephants in 12 South African facilities offering 'elephant experiences'. In 33.3% of facilities adult (>22 years) male elephants coexist with females differently to what found in the wild. Moreover, in other 25% of the facilities there are peri-pubertal males together with females, and it is unlikely that the males will be moved in the next years. We conclude that the social grouping of captive elephants in facilities is a potential source of welfare concern and warrants further investigation.

Meeting the requirements and demands of industry, consumers and the broader public is an on-going challenge for livestock industries.  Societal demands for sustainable and ethical animal production systems and practices will continue, and therefore industry must remain proactive in their effort to ensure the welfare of the animals.  Currently, there are very few welfare measures used in the livestock industries.  Mortality is one measure that is regularly used; however, a single incidence of high mortality contributes towards negative community attitudes, while the continued efforts made by industry towards managing animal welfare along the supply chain go unrecognised.  Additionally, mortality only indicates problems retrospectively and do not identify areas where conditions could be modified or welfare improved prospectively.  Rather than only being alerted once there is a problem identifying issues earlier may potentially avoid negative incidents, and provide solutions through pre-emptive modifications and adaptive management.  Other key indicators of animal welfare have been identified, such as clinical disease, wet bulb temperature, space allowance, and change in body weight.  However, some of these indicators have little potential for broad application or practicality of use.  Furthermore, for many measures, the baseline information that would allow deviance from optimum and/or critical levels to be detected has not been established.

Dogs and cats exhibit many signs of fear, phobia and anxiety that often go unrecognised by owners but they can impact significantly on the human animal bond. Many people describe teir pet as being vindictive or getting back at them when the pet is really anxious.

"Franck Péron";"Behavioural indicators of food preferences in domestic cats (Felis catus).     (#671)";"Pet food palatability is mainly assessed by looking at the intake ratios while pets are offered two different foods presented simultaneously into two bowls. In the present study we have searched for behavioural clues related to the expression of a preference and thus of food palatability in domestic cats Felis catus . Two dry diets differing in palatability - High Palatable Kibbles (HPK) and Low Palatable Kibbles (LPK) - were evaluated by a panel of 17 'expert' cats using an automated feeding station and video recordings. The cats had the opportunity to taste each diet in two different sessions, with only one diet presented at a time. A session lasted for two consecutive days with food continuously available during 20h per day. The behaviour of the cat into the feeding station was analysed for each visit and the quantity of food eaten, the speed of consumption and the latency to eat were recorded. All the individuals made at least four visits to the feeding station per day. The different quantitative variables between the two types of kibbles for the first three visits and for the last visit of each of the two days of a session were compared.  As expected, cats ate more HPK than LPK. When looking at behavioural patterns, the length of sniffing was significantly reduced with HPK on the two first visits of the first day, suggesting less hesitation in this situation. Neither the latency nor the speed of consumption was affected by the type of diet.";"Diana Pet Food, Elven, MORBIHAN, France"

The studies were performed at various types of exhibits which included the old traditional type (in cages or with poor equipment and facilities), small newly built exhibits (a one-species exhibit) and big newly built exhibits (where big animals or various species forming a large component of the ecosystem were exhibited). Each exhibit was submitted to at least 100 observations performed with a categorical technique and a duration of stay visitors was measured. Twenty five types of behaviour and reactions were identified. They were recorded in ordinal scale 0-1 and the obtained amount of points allowed to specify the most common types of behaviour and reactions. Correlation among some behaviours and reactions, arrangement of exhibitions as well as a time of observation of displays was noted e.g. the frequency of behavioural category “watching surroundings” showed highly significant differences between various exhibits (Chi-squared Test: P < 0.00001). Visitors preferred observing animals in their natural environment, although rarely, to close contact in laboratory’s environment. Visitors staying much longer at modern exhibits behaved with greater respect and admiration toward animals. As it was noticed the arrangement and the service had a great significance for a rise of an attractiveness level as well as educational value of an exhibit.";"University Social Sciences in Warsaw, Warsaw, POLAND, Poland"

"Rebecca E Doyle";"Assessing pharmacological models of anxiety in sheep     (#674)";"The use of pharmacological models can be helpful\nwhen trying to understand the origin of specific behaviours and to validate measures\nof animal welfare. In the current study 12 sheep (8-month-old merino ewes) received an intramuscular\ninjection of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP; 1 mg/kg), an anxiogenic aimed\nat causing increased agitation and distress; 12 received an intravenous\ninjection of diazepam (DZP; 0.1 mg/kg), an anxiolytic aimed at reducing agitation-related\nbehaviours; and 11 sheep acted as a control (C; saline). Thirty minutes after treatments,\nbehavioural tests were performed on each sheep individually: general movement (time\ntaken to move along a 150 m race way); behaviour in an isolation box, evaluated\nby the number of steps, 180º turns and vocalisations made; and feeding\nmotivation. The m-CPP sheep took significantly more steps than the control\nsheep while in isolation, and DZP sheep tended to take more steps than the\ncontrols (steps m-CPP=9.1, C=5.4 and DZP=7.1; m-CPP vs. C p<0.001; C vs. DZP\np=0.08). The m-CPP treated sheep performed more 180º turns than the other\ngroups (m-CPP=5.9, C=3.3 and DZP=4.3, p=0.004). No significant differences were\nidentified between the treatments for vocalisations during isolation (m-CPP=5.0,\nC=7.1 and DZP=5.9), general movement (m-CPP=61 s, C=57 s and DZP=63 s), or\nfeeding motivation (number of sheep to feed during the test: m-CPP=7, C=9 and\nDZP=9). During isolation, which is a particularly strong stressor to sheep, it\nappears that m-CPP treated sheep showed greater levels of anxiety which was\ndisplayed through increased movement. The usefulness of DZP as a model of low\nanxiety in sheep was not clear; the dosage may need modification and/or the behavioural\ntests used in this study may not identify low anxiety effectively. The current\nstudy suggests m-CPP is a useful anxiogenic, but results were not able to determine the\neffectiveness of DZP in reducing anxiety.";"Animal Welfare Science Centre, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"
"Mhairi A Sutherland";"Peripheral administration of morphine and social facilitation affect play behaviour in dairy calves     (#675)";"Play has been identified as an indicator of welfare in animals. Opioids have a modulatory effect on play behaviour in rodents, however little is known regarding the central mechanisms involved in play in ruminants. The objective of this study was to determine if opioids are involved in play behaviour in dairy calves. Twenty-four Friesian-cross dairy calves were used in this study: 12 calves were used as experimental animals receiving pharmacological intervention and the other 12 were used as ‘play’ partners. The 12 experimental calves experienced all four treatments in a cross over design: Morphine (MOR) or saline (SAL) administered intravenously 10 min prior to being tested individually (IND) or with a pen-mate (SOC) in an arena test for 20 min. Behaviour was continuously recorded by video during the 20 min test period in the arena to assess the duration of running, and frequency of running and play events. Behaviour was recorded for 6 hours post-treatment in the home pen using HOBO data loggers. Data were analysed using the MIXED procedures of SAS. Calves given MOR tended to perform more social (frontal pushing and mounting) play behaviours in the arena test (2.3 and 1.0±0.66, MOR and SAL respectively, P=0.057) and spent less time lying in the home pen (24.5 and 32.4±3.10%, MOR and SAL respectively, P<0.05) than SAL calves. Calves tested with a familiar pen-mate spent more time running (2.4 and 1.5 ±0.18 min, SOC and IND respectively, P=0.001), but performed fewer play events (bucks, jumps) than calves tested individually (14.9 and 21.3 ±2.37, SOC and IND respectively, P=0.016).

We explored the effects of unsurfaced vehicle roads on the travelling behavior of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus), using the footprint tracks left by tortoises as evidence of their travel decisions and movement patterns when confronted with vehicle tracks in sand within their habitat. Tortoises (and most other taxa leaving tracks on the roads) did not appear to make use of roads for travel but attempted to cross them directly, the success of which was influenced by the size of the individual: smaller animals (presumably younger tortoises) were more challenged than larger animals by both sand road widths and depths of vehicle ruts in sand roads. Sand roads may present both physical and physiological challenges to gopher tortoises, particularly to small ones. This research provided further evidence that the negative influence of roads in fragmenting the environment is not limited to vehicle mortality, and may be mediated by animal size.";"Curtin University: Behavioural Ecology, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia"

It is \nan important trophic regulator, usually feeding on small native rodents \nand medium sized macropods. Dingoes, in general, tend to exist in small \npacks of 3-12 individuals which they self-regulate through the \nexclusion of members and outsiders.These normal behaviours change, however, \nwhen the dingo hybridises with free ranging feral domesticated dogs. \nWith high densities of feral dogs spreading from population centres \ndingo populations frequently hybridise with feral dogs, adopting their \nbehavioural tendencies in the process. Packs cease to self-regulate in \nsize, often increasing in number exponentially. This increase in \npredator density leads to trophic cascading and eventually ecosystem \ncollapse. Furthermore hybrid packs are bolder around human settlements, \nlack hierarchical systems and are far more likely to hunt livestock; \ndamaging the livelihood of rural communities. In some areas of the \ncountry hybridisation has reached catastrophic levels; it is estimated that only 17% of wild dogs in Victoria could still be classified as dingoes.Due\n to the evolutionary plasticity of canines - both behaviourally and \nphysically - distinguishing dingoes, hybrids and feral dogs from one \nanother is the subject of much debate. Skull morphologies, \nmicrosatellites and coat colouration have all been assessed but there is\n room for debate in all methods discovered so far. It is vitally \nimportant that a system be found.

Nevertheless, light pollution is a relatively new term, since artificial light affects the environment in more subtle ways than any other anthropogenic factors, e.g. habitat destruction or noise.  Birds are important model species in regard to this, since their behaviour and reproductive cycle is known to be highly sensitive towards light conditions. To investigate how light-at-night affects the reproductive performance of passerines, we conducted an experiment on a population of wild living blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus ). We combined results of a correlative long term study with an experimental approach. Therefore we established artificial light sources at nestboxes during the nest-building period and compared breeding phenology and nestling condition between (i) natural habitats, (ii) experimental groups and (iii) street-lamp territories.  Our results reveal that birds choosing to breed around street lamps are not affected in breeding performance, whereas birds âforcedâ to breed under changed ambient light conditions produce nestlings with lower body condition in comparison to natural habitats.  Our results support the idea that artificial light sources affect the breeding performance of birds and bring additional knowledge important for conservation. ";"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, AUSTRIA, Austria"
"Jana I. Wolf";"Let other queens do the work- intraspecific social parasitism as a form of reproductive conflict in the ant Myrmica ruginodis     (#685)";"Reproductive conflicts are ubiquitous\nin animals and occur in many different forms. When several reproducing queens co-exist\nin a same social insect nest, conflicts can evolve between them not only about\nwho is permitted to reproduce in the first place, but also about which kind of\noffspring is produced. This means that some queens may avoid producing workers\nand thus not contribute to the maintenance of the nest. Instead they may take\nadvantage of the already established worker force of other queens and focus only\n(or mainly) on producing sexual offspring. In the ant Myrmica ruginodis, queen size dimorphism has been suggested to be\nconnected to an incipient stage of such parasitic relationship, where the\nsmaller queen morph (microgynes) is assumed to be a parasite of the larger\nqueen morph (macrogynes). Furthermore it has been suggested that such\nintraspecific parasitism can lead to reproductive isolation between the two size\nmorphs and that it might eventually lead to sympatric speciation between the\nparasite and the host. In the ant Myrmica ruginodis nests usually belong\nto one of the morphs, but when the morphs coexist in the same nests,\nreproductive specialization is a possible mechanism causing genetic divergence\nbetween the morphs. To examine possible reproductive specialization of the\nmorphs, we collected queens and their sexual and worker offspring for genetic\nanalysis, focussing especially on nests where both morphs co-existed. We shall\ndetermine whether microgyne queens specialize in sexual production in mixed\nnests and if this phenomenon enhances reproductive isolation between the two size\nmorphs of the ant Myrmica ruginodis.";"University of Helsinki, Helsinki, UUSIMAA, Finland"

"Maxime Pineaux";"Female dispersal in response to sexual conflict in a water strider species     (#687)";"In water striders, there is sexual conflict over mating rate: males\nfrequently harass females to gain matings, and females resist mating attempts.\nIt is generally admitted that females stop resisting and accept superfluous\ncopulations when male harassment is too intense. However, evidence for convenience\npolyandry comes from experiments using few individuals confined to a small area.\nMoreover, convenience polyandry has rarely been observed in nature, where females\nlikely have the opportunity to disperse away from harsh conditions imposed by male\nharassment. We performed an experiment with Gerris\nbuenoi to investigate the effect of sexual conflict on dispersal behaviour.\nWe hypothesized that dispersal can serve to attenuate sexual conflict and\npredicted that 1) females should disperse more than males, 2) female dispersal should\nincrease with sexual conflict intensity, and 3) males should have a similar but\nweaker response than females. Three sex ratios were used to create three\ndifferent sexual conflict intensities in semi-natural populations. Dispersal\nwas monitored daily for 15 days. Additionally, we made behavioural observations\nto investigate if dispersal was influenced by individual traits (mating rate,\nharassment rate, body size). As expected, females dispersed more than males under\nall intensities of sexual conflict. Also, female dispersal increased with\nsexual conflict. Males dispersed significantly more when sexual conflict was\nmost intense (under male-biased sex ratio). Our results indicate that dispersal allows escaping from sexual\nconflict in G. buenoi.

"Noriko Yasuoka";"Factors affecting sexual expression in a natural population of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas     (#690)";" The sexuality of oysters is unique in that individuals with diverse sexual expressions may co-occur in a single species. However, little information is available on the sexual expressions in natural populations of oysters, which impedes to discuss the adaptive significance of the diverse sexual systems. In this study, we conducted field samplings and in situ experiments to examine sexual expression of Crassostrea gigas. First, during the reproductive season (spring to autumn) of 2012, the sex ratios was investigated in relation to shell length, sampling month, and gregariousness (whether they were solitary or clumped when collected). Almost all mature individuals were either males or females, with simultaneous hermaphrodites encountered very infrequently. The proportion of males was found to decrease with increasing shell length, although many large individuals remained male. The proportion of males was greater in clumped than solitary individuals.  Second, we observed annual changes of sexual expression by following the same individuals in the field.  The sex of collected specimens was identified by biopsy, and they were then returned to the sites of their collection during the reproductive season of 2013 with or without changing their gregariousness. When the individuals were re-collected the following year, sex change in both directions was observed. The frequency of sex change from male to female was higher when the oysters were placed solitarily.  We concluded that C. gigas have a tendency of protandrous hermaphroditism and the ability to change sex in both directions. These findings suggest that sexual expression in C. gigas is labile, in that not all change sex from male to female at a fixed size. The sexual expression was also affected by the presence of neighboring individuals. Such labile sexual expression may be adaptive for sessile organisms.";"Graduate School of Humanities and Science, Nara Women's University, Nara, Japan"

However, divorce is their\nonly option to obtain a social mate that is more compatible or of higher quality. To understand the drivers\nand consequences of divorce, an analysis should integrate ecological and\ndemographic factors intrinsic to the social and genetic mating system of any\nspecies. Here we study divorce in Malurus coronatus, a cooperatively breeding,\nyear-round territorial fairy-wren with long-term pair bonds and low levels of EP\npaternity. Based on 8 years of data, divorce occurred 4 times more often in\nincestuous pairs (55% of 34 pairs) than non-incestuous pairs (14 % of 276). All\nfirst-order relatives that were familiar to each other divorced, whereas\ndivorce was much rarer for non-familiar incestuous pairs (1 of 6), indicating\nthat these fairy-wrens recognize their relatives by association. Non-incestuous\npairs had higher likelihood of divorce if they previously had at least one EP\noffspring: EP offspring occurred in 21% of divorcing pairs that reproduced\n(compared to 8% in non-divorcing pairs). This suggests that divorce is\nimportant to obtain genetic as well as direct benefits from a permanent new\npartner. However, reproductive failure per se was not a cause for\ndivorce. Instead, pair bonds of incestuous and non-incestuous pairs were\nterminated sooner by individuals in smaller groups, highlighting the cost of\nleaving a large group with many helpers. Predominantly females (in 75% of divorces)\ndispersed after divorce, and they moved to higher quality territories. This shows that\ndivorce, and by extension mate choice, must to some extent be considered a side\neffect of territory choice. Taken together, our findings suggest that mostly\nfemale fairy-wrens strategically leave an incestuous or otherwise suboptimal\npartner, and that social benefits of cooperative breeding as well as territory\nquality inform the decision to disperse and divorce";"School of Biological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia"

We divided the rice-paddy complex into 14 sectors that were\ncomposed of adjacent rice paddies with a similar water level.

On the contrary, the typical ethologist may more likely to be concerned with how specific behaviors evolved and in an animal’s species typical responses to stimuli they are likely to encounter in their natural environment.  Perhaps the most successful attempt at a theoretical and methodological integration of animal learning and ethology has been the development of the behavior systems approach (Timberlake, 1983; 1994; Timberlake & Lucas, 1989). Behavior systems conceptualize experiential learning not as a set of universal principles, but as species typical processes that reflect the specific demands of the ecological niche in which the species evolved. Behavior systems have been developed for the analysis of learned defensive and feeding behaviors in rats (Fanselow, 1994, 1997; Timberlake, 1994), the development of pecking behavior and dustbathing in jungle fowl (Hogan, 1994) and the sexual behavior of male domesticated quail (Domjan, 1994).  The latter example is the focus of the current presentation.  Male Japanese quail display a wide range of behaviors prior to, during, and after mating.  A behavior system has been developed that describes both unconditioned and Pavlovian conditioned effects of sexual behavior (Domjan, 1994).  Conditioned effects are of particular interest because what an animal learns about predictive relationships between stimuli and responses ultimately reflects the potential demands of the particular ecological niche in which it has evolved.  The purpose of the current presentation is to review and bring-to-date Domjan’s sexual behavior system and describe data that support the system.";"University of Kentucky, Lexington, KENTUCKY, United States"
"Stuart Biggs";"Female mate choice for male diet quality in the fawn-footed melomys Melomys cervinipes     (#695)";"Diet plays an important role\nin the life-history characteristics of animals, with physical condition and\nconcomitant reproductive success being strongly influenced by diet quality. Furthermore,\ndiet quality may influence the establishment of secondary sexual\ncharacteristics, which play a role in mate attraction. In tropical rainforests,\nwhere high quality resources might be temporally or spatially variable, the\ndiet quality of a potential mate could signal enhanced foraging and\nresource-acquisition ability. Melomys\ncervinipes is a medium-sized, semi-arboreal rodent endemic to the Wet\nTropics of Queensland, Australia. It plays an important role in tropical\nrainforest dynamics as a seed disperser and prey item. Remarkably little is\nknown of its general biology and behaviour. Therefore, I aim to investigate whether\nfemale mate choice in the fawn-footed melomys Melomys cervinipes is influenced by dietary protein levels, a\nmeasure of diet quality, of males. I will feed male M. cervinipes one of two diets: commercial rodent feed (protein:\n17%) or commercial rodent feed supplemented with a whey protein isolate\n(protein: 40.7%). Males will be fed the diet for at least two weeks prior to\nchoice tests. Bedding will then be collected from both males and used in female mate choice tests. In two-way choice tests, I\nwill present oestrus females with the odour cues of both males. I predict that\nfemales will prefer males fed the higher quality diet. Given the paucity of\nbehavioural studies on Australian rodents in general, my results will provide\nvaluable insight into the behaviour an important rainforest species.\nFurthermore, it will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying mate choice via odour preferences based on diet quality.";"College of Marine and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Cairns, Queensland, Australia"

The small plovers, genus Charadrius, are cosmopolitan shorebirds, distributed across all continents except Antarctica. Here we present a global, species-level molecular phylogeny of this group based on a Bayesian multispecies coalescent analysis of four nuclear (ADH5, FIB7, MYO2 and RAG1) and two mitochondrial (COI and ND3) genes, and use the phylogeny to examine the biogeographic origin of the genus. In contrast to earlier work, ancestral area analyses supported an origin of the Charadrius plovers in the Northern hemisphere. We propose that major radiations in this group were associated with shifts in the range of these ancestral plover species, leading to colonisation of the Southern hemisphere. With this phylogeny, we deliver the first tangible opportunity for tracking where and how mating systems have evolved in plovers.";"Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK"

These sperms were transferred to the bursa copulatrix of the female within a single spermatophore at mating. Therefore, both types of sperm migrate to the spermatheca. As the adaptive significance of apyrene sperm migration to the spermatheca, the cheap filler hypothesis that highly motile apyrene sperm in the spermatheca reduce female receptivity to re-mating has been developed in studies of polyandrous species. However, males of monandrous species also produce apyrene sperm. Thus, study on apyrene spermof monandrous species would be valuable to clarify the role of apyrene sperm. The sperm dynamics in females and the motility of eupyrene and apyrene sperm in the spermatheca were examined in the monandrous swallowtail butterfly, Byasa alcinous, in Japan. Sperm migration was occurred for eupyrene and apyrene sperm within 1 day after copulation. More than 10,000 apyrene sperm and 5,000 eupyrene sperm remained in the spermatheca at least 8 days after copulation. While eupyrene sperm maintained their motility for 8 days, apyrene sperm lost their motility soon after the arriving at spermatheca, and no motile apyrene sperm were found 8 days after the copulation. Since the cheap filler hypothesis requires the apyrene sperm in the spermatheca to show high motility, an alternative hypothesis that apyrene sperm assist migration of eupyrene sperm from spermatophore to spermatheca or that apyrene sperm ingested as nutrition by female for monandrous species was discussed.";"College of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki pref., Japan"
"Makoto ITOH";"Why do female pond frogs call? : Possible function of female vocalization in frogs to avoid reproductive interference     (#701)";"Strict clearly mechanisms of reproductive isolation is important especially for closely related species that inhabit the same habitat. If they misidentify reproductive signals, they incur negative effects of reproductive interference between them. Thus, there should be some mechanisms to avoid reproductive interference between related species that are syntopic and simultaneity breeds in nature. Pelophylax porosus brevipodus and P. nigromaculatus are closely related species of frogs, which syntopically occur and simultanously breed in some areas of Japan. Female vocalization was recently found in these frogs. Generally, male frogs produce calls, whereas female frogs do not positively emit calls in the reproductive season. Based on these facts, I proposed a hypothesis that female calls of P. p. brevipodus and P. nigromaculatus are used for reproductive isolation. In the present study, to clarify the function of the female calls, I observed their interspecific and intraspecific male-female interactions, in particular, male responses to female calls, in the breeding season. In the first experiment, I placed one male and one female together in a test tank and observed their behavior. In the second experiment, I placed one male in the test tank and played back conspecific or heterospecific female calls. I found that the female calls of both species had no effects on male P. p. brevipodus, whereas male P. nigromaculatus became motionless in response to those calls. This result suggests that the female calls of P. p. brevipodus and P. nigromaculatus have negative effects on male P. nigromaculatus activity in the breeding season. It is likely that female calls of both species have the function as a reject signal against courting males. Especially, this function would be effective to reduce reproductive interference between female P. p. brevipodus and male P. nigromaculatus.";"Kyoto University, Kyoto-shi, KYOTO-FU, Japan"
"Tatsuro Konagaya";"Adaptive significance of pre-overwinter copulation of autumn-morph females with non-overwintering summer-morph males in the Japanese common grass yellow, Eurema mandarina     (#702)";"Autumn-morph\nadults of the Japanese common grass yellow,\nEurema mandarina, overwinter with reproductive diapause, while the\nsummer-morph adults do not. Because of different critical photoperiod between\nthe sexes, the summer-morph males fly sympatrically with the autumn-morph\nadults in late autumn during which autumn-morph males show little mating\nactivity. Consequently, mating between summer-morph males and autumn-morph\nfemales frequently occurs, and females stored sperm inseminated from\nsummer-morph males throughout the winter. After overwintering, mated\nautumn-morph females commonly re-mate with autumn-morph males. Two hypotheses,\na nuptial gift hypothesis and a risk-hedge hypothesis, explaining the adaptive\nsignificance of pre-overwinter copulation by autumn-morph females have been\nproposed. Then, timing of re-mating and the onset of oviposition after\noverwintering in relation to the population dynamics were examined by\ndissecting the autumn-morph females and by the mark-and-recapture method in the\nfield. There were no mature eggs in the ovaries of the autumn-morph females in\nthe autumn, though most of them already have a spermatophore derived from the\nsummer-morph males. About 25 mature eggs were found in late March, indicating\nthat egg maturation was occurred immediately after the overwintering. The\ndecrease in the number of eggs contained in autumn-morph females indicated that\nthey started oviposition in mid-April. The shape of the spermatophores in the\nbursa copulatrix suggested that most autumn-morph females re-mated with\nautumn-morph males before mid-April. Because autumn-morph females have\nsufficient chance to mate with autumn-morph males before the onset of\noviposition after overwintering, the nuptial gift hypothesis is more plausible\nthan the risk-hedge hypothesis. In addition, because the mortality of autumn-morph\nadults during overwintering was about 50 %, nutrition for overwinter must be\nimportant. High survival rate of autumn-morph females rather than autumn-morph\nmales after overwintering suggested that the ejaculates transferred from males\nmight be a nuptial gift as well as sperm supplying. ";"University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan"
"Takahiro Sato";"Feeding, sperm storage and copulation during hibernation period in Rhinolophus cornutus.

And this selection pressure would make hibernating bats active frequently\nto increase mating chance although arousing from hibernation is energetically too\nexpensive. Rhinolophus cornutus has\ndelayed fertilization. In the most heavy snowfall region of Japan, flight\nactivity in this species during wintering has often been observed. We hypothesized\nthat flight activity after arousal plays an important role in increasing mating\nchances because mating period in active season is limited to a few months in\nheavy snowfall region and bats may be exposed by strong sperm competition. We\ninvestigated bats’ behaviour during periodic arousals throughout hibernation\nperiod to reveal significance of flight activity in heavy snowfall region.      Field research was conducted from June\n2011 to June 2015 in Osawa cave, Niigata. During wintering, the number of bats\nemerging from the cave was counted. Subsequently, both emerging bats and\nreturned bats were captured by mist net. On the average, 30-120 bats emerged\noutside the roost despite of snowfall. DNA barcoding analysis using the feces\ncollected from the returned bats showed that three genera of Diptera were used\nas diet during wintering. 89% of the emerging males showed distension of cauda\nepididymis. Interestingly, males kept spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis throughout\nhibernation period. Behavior tracking of bats after arousal revealed that males\nwith distended cauda epididymis and females with opened vagina swarmed near the\ncave entrance. Furthermore, a microscopic examination on vaginal smear of\nfemales from this swarming cluster showed that spermatozoa existed in vagina. These\nresults suggest that winter copulation may provide chances for insemination in\naddition to autumn copulation, and winter foraging may play an important role in\nretaining spermatozoa in male. ";"Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata City, NIIGATA PREFECTURE, Japan"

We studied male reproductive investment via sexual cannibalism in the praying mantid Tenodera sinensis. Males and females were each fed differently radiolabeled crickets (Acheta domesticus) and allowed to mate. We allowed half of the pairs to progress to sexual cannibalism and prevented cannibalism in the other half. We assess the relative allocation of both male-derived somatic materials and ejaculate materials into the eggs and soma of the female. Our results show that male somatic investment offsets female investment in offspring. Eggs and reproductive tissues of females that cannibalized their mates contained significantly more male-derived amino acids. There was also a marginally nonsignificant increase in eggs produced subsequent to sexual cannibalism. Sexual cannibalism thus increases male material investment in offspring. We also show that males provide substantial investment via the ejaculate, with males passing 25.1% of their radiolabeled amino acids to females via the ejaculate even in the absence of cannibalism.";"Department of Biology, State University of New York, Fredonia, New York, USA"

"Arno Cimadom";"The importance of male age on the breeding success of small tree finches     (#708)";"Because of the high costs related to reproduction, females seek reliable indicators of male quality when choosing their mate. Plumage characteristics can be such an indicator in birds, giving information about health, nutritional stage and in several species also the age. Age can also be seen as indirect indicator for male experience. In Darwinâs small tree finches (Camarhynchus parvulus ), male head colouration becomes progressively darker with age and can be reliably tell the age of a male individual. A previous study by Kleindorfer (2007) showed that females of this species prefer older males and have a higher breeding success when paired with older males. To find out why older males are better, we compared several parameters of the breeding biology between younger and older males over the course of three breeding seasons. Analysis showed no significant differences between the two age groups in terms of clutch size and brood size. However, in 2012 but not in 2014, older males had a significantly higher number of fledglings. A possible explanation lies in the different weather conditions of the two years: 2012 was characterised by periods of intense rain and a high percentage of nests were abandoned; 2014 was a very dry year and nest abandonment was rare. Older males tended to abandon nests more frequently than younger males, suggesting that they were better in assessing when environmental conditions do not favour successful rearing of the current brood. An alternative explanation is that older males are better at compensating for increased environmental stress (e.g. food shortage). Furthermore, males seem to perfect different abilities (e.g. foraging, evaluation of breeding conditions) successively pointing towards the possibility that males learn different competences at different points during their life cycle.";"Department of Behavioural Biology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"

"Janet L Leonard";"Gender Plasticity  and the Evolution of Sexual Systems in Animals     (#712)";"In the Metazoa there are two common sexual systems; dioecy and simultaneous hermaphroditism with outcrossing.  These sexual systems are often characteristic of whole phyla and classes and have been very stable over evolutionarily time and a great deal of environmental change.  Other sexual systems such as sequential hermaphroditism, gynodioecy, androdioecy, etc, occur more rarely and are not evolutionarily stable in the sense that they are characteristic of major clades such as phyla and classes.  .  In angiosperms the evolutionary paths from dioecy to simultaneous hermaphroditism are well understood and typically involve either gynodiocey or androdioecy.  This is not the case in animals. Gynodioecy is extremely rare in animals. Although androdioecy has evolved repeatedly in animals, the hermaphrodites do not outcross as males, but either self-fertilize or act as females to males, except in barnacles.  In barnacles androdioecy can be a transitional state between dioecy and outcrossing simultaneous hermaphroditism.  Here I suggest that phenotypic plasticity in gender, based on social cues, including sequential hermaphroditism and environmental sex determination (ESD) may be a common evolutionary path between outcrossing simultaneous hermaphroditism and dioecy in animals. Recent work has demonstrated that simultaneous hermaphroditism often involves changes in sex allocation as function of age, size and social environment.  These changes in sex allocation can blur the distinction between simultaneous and sequential hermaphroditism.  Similarly, with ESD, a single genotype may develop as either a male, female or hermaphrodite depending on social and/or other environmental cues.  The distinction between sequential hermaphroditism and ESD has again become very blurry.  A plausible evolutionary path between simultaneous hermaphroditism and dioecy might start with simultaneous hermaphrodites which alter sex allocation according to social conditions evolving to sequential hermaphrodites and then these sequential hermaphrodites evolving an earlier and earlier sex change in response to social cues until there is effectively ESD of separate sexes.  This could then evolve into genetically determined dioecy which is unresponsive to early social cues.";"University of California-Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, United States"

First, eggs fertilized by aged sperm with impaired structure and/or\ndamaged genetic material may suffer lower fertilization prospects and possible\ntransgenerational effect that compromise offspring survival and fitness. Such\neffects may generate sexual conflict and explain why female typically mate\nmultiply (in species where direct benefits of polyandry are not obvious).

"Dianne H Brunton";"Multiple functions of complex vocalisations by a socially monogamous female songbird: Does female song influence reproductive success?     (#271)";"The study of female song in a socially monogamous territorial bird provides an opportunity to understand selective pressures specific to females. We looked at the influence of female song behaviour on the quality of the mate and breeding territory acquired. We examined how female song and singing behaviour correlated with body condition and reproductive success. Finally, we determined whether there is a trade-off between female song production and investing in offspring. We investigated female song in the New Zealand endemic bellbird (Anthornis melanura), a passerine breeding in temperate forest habitats. We monitored bellbird breeding activity on Tiritiri Matangi Island between 2007-2009 and 2012-2014. The density of bellbirds within the study area was approximately 4.7 pairs/ha. The frequency of female singing bouts increased through the breeding season, whereas male singing bouts decreased. Female song production was highest during egg-laying and late chick-rearing and lowest during incubation and early chick-rearing. Female bellbirds were more active than males in parental care and a female’s song complexity and singing rates were positively associated with the amount of male parental care but not male body condition. Females in better condition sung more frequently and used syllables with lower frequencies.  The more aggressive female responses during courtship and chick-rearing reflect the costs of territory intrusions and we suggest a trade-off between paternal care and territorial defence. Female defence, particularly towards female neighbours, may provide a mechanism for preventing polygyny and reducing the risk of loss of male parental care. It is unclear why male body size/condition was not associated with reproductive success and we speculate that extra-pair paternity must be considered to understand male reproductive success for this species. We conclude that a bellbird female’s singing behaviour is fundamental to her reproductive success and her defence of a quality territory and mate.";"Ecology, Conservation and Behaviour Group, Massey University, INMS, Auckland, New Zealand"

Studies on these phases have shown variability in development over\ntime between species but not between sexes. Here we compare the motor phases for\nboth sexes and describe how female song develops in the New Zealand Bellbird (Anthornis melanura), a species where\nboth sexes sing a diversity of complex song types. Sub-song was sung by females as young as 6 weeks old and 4\nweeks old in males. Plastic song was detected at 15 weeks old in females and 13\nweeks old in males. Both sexes sung a full repertoire of crystallised songs prior\nto their first breeding season. Spectral analysis and consistency correlations\nwere used to analyse the female syllables throughout the song motor phases at\ndifferent age groups.  Peak frequency and\nentropy of individual syllables stabilised and became more consistent over\ntime. The delivery of individual syllables also varied with more complex\nsyllables taking longer to stabilise than others. Hence, female NZ bellbirds\ndevelop complex song types in an equivalent manner to males, and comparable to\nthe development in other male oscines. The research on song function and\nontogeny in female NZ bellbirds has significant implications for current\nknowledge of the evolution of song and its functions.  This research also provides a foundation for\nunderstanding the costs and benefits of female song repertoires and has\nimplications for the development of local song dialects.

The integral role of vocal tutors\nfor song learning has been well documented for species where song is a\nmale-specific trait primarily used for mate attraction and territory defence.\nYoung birds often learn from more than one tutor, which increases their song\ncomplexity or song repertoire. Female song has recently been recognised as a\nwidespread trait in songbirds yet there is a lack of understanding about the\nrole adult vocal tutors plays in song learning by males and females.

Both males and females sing solo song to defend\nthe year-round territory. We examine the effect of parental vocal tutoring effort\non song learning in sons and daughters. We test (1) if there is a correlation\nbetween vocal complexity of combined parental element repertoire and offspring element\nrepertoire and (2) if parental vocal tutor song rate predicts the occurrence of\nelements in offspring song. First, we compared song elements per male and\nfemale pair to determine the parental element repertoire, and recorded parental\nsong rate across ten weeks after the nestlings had fledged. Next, we examined\nfledgling song elements in relation to parental song elements, fledgling sex,\nand parental tutoring effort. The fledgling song had a combination of shared\nand unique parental song elements and had similar complexity in sons and\ndaughters. Higher song rate per tutor predicted more unique song elements for\nthat tutor in the song of male and female fledglings.

"Masayo Soma";"Evolution of courtship display in Estrildid finches: Dance in relation to female song and plumage ornamentation     (#274)";"Estrildid finches are known for great interspecific diversity in the degree of elaboration in courtship dance, song and plumage coloration and also for the considerable sex differences in these traits within species. To study the evolution of multimodal sexual signaling in these taxa, we collected data on 85 species and analyzed them in a phylogenetic comparative study. As dances are often displayed in parallel with songs and include behavioral elements to emphasize coloration, they are likely to evolve non-independently of songs and plumage characteristics. Hence, we hypothesized that the degree of elaboration in dance would be associated with song and plumage ornamentation due to correlated responses between traits. Alternatively, each sexual signal may evolve independently of the others under the influence of different aspects of reproductive ecology or life history. Finally, because trait expression occurs in both males and females and can be caused by pleiotropic effects, we predicted correlated exaggerations of the traits between sexes as well. We found that courtship dance, song and plumage coloration evolve independently, as these traits were not correlated among species in either sex (i.e. the presence of female song were not related to female dance repertoire). However, we found evidence for correlated responses between the sexes, as species that have males with complex dances or colorful plumage also have females with exaggerated traits. Yet, selection factors acting on these traits were only partially shared between sexes. While coloration can be predicted by intraspecific brood parasitism and dance by body size in females, we were unable to reveal similar relationships in males. Our results indicate that different secondary sexual characters in Estrildids finches evolved under the influence of complicated selection factors, in which both correlated responses between sexes as well as independent selective mechanisms play roles.";"Hokkaido University, Sapporo, HOKKAIDO, Japan"

We use published data on female song for ~600 species of\nsongbirds and a novel approach that allows for the reliable and objective\ncomparison of colour elaboration between species and genders. On the one hand,\na negative correlation between acoustic and visual elaboration is expected if\nthere is an evolutionary trade-off between signalling modes.

However, a lack of\nability to experimentally manipulate promiscuity levels within populations has\nhampered progress in directly testing these predictions. Moreover, traditional\nmeasures of the strength of sexual selection, such as the Bateman gradient (the\ncorrelation between the number of mates and number of offspring), only capture\npre-copulatory, but not post-copulatory, sexual selection. To address these\nissues we genetically manipulated female sexual receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster and generated\nhyper-promiscuous populations.

In this study, we investigated: 1) how sequence and timing of arrival affects interactions between\nhabitat generalists and specialists in healthy and degrading environments and 2)\nhow prior residency interacts with habitat quality and resource specialisation to\naffect propensity to migrate. We conducted manipulative field studies using the\ndamselfishes Pomacentrus amboinensis,a habitat generalist, and Pomacentrus moluccensis, a live coral\nspecialist, on live or dead coral habitats. Timing of arrival differed between\nearly and late arrivers (residents and intruders, respectively) by 1, 3 or 24\nhours. Our results demonstrated that the strength of priority effects (i.e.\naggression intensity) increased with increasing timing of arrival, suggesting that\nwillingness to defend valuable resources increases with the length of the\npriority period. Propensity to migrate from dead to live coral varied depending\non which species was the resident, with P.\nmoluccensis (live coral specialist) more likely to migrate when it was the\nresident than P. amboinensis (habitat\ngeneralist). This indicates that both prior residency and resource\nspecialisation affect propensity to migrate to higher quality habitats, which\nwill impact future success. The degree to which ecological versatility and\npriority effects modify competitive outcomes in coral reef fishes is important\nto understand, in order to predict how our changing environment will impact\nfish community dynamics.

"Weihong Ji";"Urban noise affects multiple aspects of avian song     (#119)";"One of the main urban effects on wildlife habitats is increased degree of habitat heterogeneity at a micro-geographic level, which leads to such effects as reduced habitat size, altered community structure, and changes in light and acoustic conditions. Little is known about how increased variation in habitat conditions at a micro-geographical level affects animal populations. In this study, we use tui, a native New Zealand honeyeater with complex vocalizations, as a model to investigate how variations in the noise level in urban habitats affect song structure and singing behavior of birds. Our results show that tui songs at sites with higher noise levels had higher minimum frequency,  higher aggregate entropy, and reduced proportion of trill components within their songs. Tui also reduced the duration of songs and syllable diversity per song at noisy habitats compared to quieter sites within the same suburb.  We have also recorded a higher within-site variance in syllable repertoire among individuals in urban sites compared to non-urban sites, suggesting a response to the heterogeneity in noise levels within a site. Bird songs are known to be sexually selected traits. Such urban effects on singing behaviour of song birds are likely to have further implications, such as altering breeding behavior, mating systems and individual fitness; all of which warrant further research.";"Massey University, Auckland/Albany, AUCKLAND, New Zealand"

Over the past decade, studies of animal personality\nhave received much attention and have been reported in a wide range of taxa, but\nmainly in mammals and avians. Personality is assumed to be formed by interaction\nbetween inherent factors (genetic or maternal effects) and environmental\nfactors (experiences or surrounding conditions). However, there are few studies\ninvestigating the effects of environmental factors, especially from the developmental\nperspective. I studied personality of a parthenogenetic gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, which clone\npopulations are known to live in the wild. Genetically identical animals are\nideal for investigating the developmental aspect of personality. I collected\ngeckos in the field and experimentally evaluated boldness and exploration in the\nlaboratory. To investigate the presence of personality, I first examined\nwhether behavior is consistent across contexts (contextual generality) and\nthrough time (repeatability). I found individuals with various boldness among the\npopulation, and the same individuals maintained consistent bold tendencies over\ncontexts and time. The occurrence of behavioral variation among individuals and\nthe consistency within individuals indicated that clone geckos have\npersonality. Next I investigated the development of personality. Generally,\nindividuals experiences more things as they grow, thus it can be assumed that\npersonality variation among individuals becomes greater throughout growth. I\ndefined four growth stages based on body size of geckos and compared boldness\nvariation among them. In the youngest stage most individuals showed high\nboldness score, and personality variation was low. On the other hand, in other older\nstages there were various individuals, from bold to shy ones, and therefore personality\nvariation was high. This result suggests that personality variation among individuals\nincreases throughout growth.";"Kyoto University, Kyoto, KYOTO, Japan"

Recent hypotheses suggest that animal personalities are\nassociated with differences in key life-history traits such as growth,\nfecundity, and mortality (“productivity-personality” hypothesis). Nevertheless,\nit remains unclear whether behavioural and life-history profiles are set early\nin life or, instead, represent the adaptive outcome of distinct optimal\nstrategies in which bold and active individuals result to be both risk-prone and\nhighly competitive in resource acquisition. Here, we explore the\nrelationship between personality and life history across the ontogeny of the invasive\neastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Since low\ngenetic diversity represents an ideal condition to explore inter-individual\nvariations in phenotypes, we utilize\nfirst generation siblings from a highly inbred wild mosquitofish population.\nExperimental fish have been housed individually since birth and fed abundantly\nto allow individuals expressing their intrinsic life-history profiles in\nabsence of competition phenomena.

Our\nresults show that personality profiles are not manifested in newly born fish\nand are, instead, observed in sub-adult and adult stages. Such behavioural differences\namong individuals appear only in relation to risk-taking behaviours and do not\nreflect variations in fish body mass and body length.

Currently,\nstudies have focussed almost exclusively on the efficacy of passive trapping\nmethods (e.g. baited traps) that rely on the arrival and inspection of animals,\nwhere bold, explorative individuals are typically oversampled. Whether more\nactive search strategies result in similar bias remains unclear. In this study,\nwe compared three different trapping methods (hand capture, pitfall trapping\nand mealworm fishing) in their ability to capture a range of behavioural types\nwithin a population of the delicate skink (Lampropholis delicata). We\nalso tested whether a behavioural syndrome was present. Whilst significant\nbehavioural variation existed within the population, we found no difference\nbetween individuals caught in the three trapping methods amongst five\nbehavioural traits.

For robust conclusions, such analyses depend on accurate\ninformation about activity periods. In the past, the viviparous, rock-dwelling\ngecko Woodworthia “Otago-Southland” from southern New Zealand (formerly Hoplodactylus maculatus) has often been categorized as nocturnal as it forages extensively\nat night. However, our group’s studies show this description to be incomplete.\nField observations using time-lapse photography confirm extensive basking in\ndirect sunlight, especially by females (Gibson, Penniket and Cree, BJLS in\npress). Laboratory studies confirm that basking is context-specific (dependent\non the thermal benefits) and practised more by pregnant females than by\nnon-pregnant females or males. When only a narrow shaft of radiation is\navailable, pregnant females often bask “on toes”, raising the surface temperature of the\nabdomen, above the developing embryos, to 30°C or more while the body\nextremities remain much closer to the ambient temperature of 16°C. This species\ntherefore exhibits diurnal and nocturnal behaviours in both field and\nlaboratory situations, and it should be classed as diurno-nocturnal. Diurno-nocturnality\nis likely to be widespread amongst viviparous New Zealand geckos traditionally\nclassed as nocturnal. If climate change leads to warmer air temperatures with\nno reduction in solar radiation, then basking by Woodworthia “Otago-Southland” (with its attendant risks of\npredation) may decline, leading to more exclusively nocturnal emergence.\nFurther warming could be followed by a declining use of superficial rock slabs\nas retreats.

Two main ways are 1) by increasing the ornament's colour or brightness contrast against the background and 2) by increasing the size of the ornament. Conspicuous ornaments also carry a greater risk of predation. We assess the relationship between the colour and size of the dewlap of several species of gliding lizards (genus Draco) from Malaysia and the Philippines. We found a negative relationship between colour contrast against the background and relative dewlap size, suggesting that increasing colour contrast and relative dewlap size are alternative strategies for effective communication. Male relative dewlap size increases with increasing sexual size dimorphism, and dewlap colour and brightness contrast increase with increasing sexual dichromatism in colour and brightness respectively, suggesting that sexual selection is acting on both dewlap size and colour.  We further show that species employing greater relative dewlap size for conspicuousness are those found in high predation habitats, whilst species employing greater colour contrast are found in relatively low predation habitats. These results suggest that the use of larger or more colourful dewlaps as strategies for effective communication may be driven by the interaction between sexual selection and predation risk.";"UNSW, Sydney"

"Corina Logan";"Is innovation a good indicator of complex cognition?     (#328)";"The number of innovations (novel foraging techniques) a species has is considered an indicator of complex cognition because it positively correlates with relative brain size (corrected for body size). However, smaller-brained species are rarely tested for complex cognition, therefore our understanding of the relationship between complex cognition and relative brain size is incomplete. Here I compare innovative New Caledonian crows and great-tailed grackles (who both have broad diets) with the less innovative Western Scrub-jays (who have specialized diets) on a series of Aesop’s Fable water displacement experiments. This comparison tests whether innovative species perform better on a task requiring general problem solving abilities, which are another potential indicator of complex cognition in addition to innovation. Crows and grackles preferred functional options in tasks, while scrub-jays did not. These results support the hypothesis that innovativeness indicates complex cognition. However, innovativeness does not track brain size because the smaller-brained but innovative grackles performed similarly to large-brained, innovative crows, while the large-brained yet less innovative scrub-jays performed poorly. Since scrub-jays exhibit general problem solving abilities in a caching context, this demonstrates that there are multiple pathways to complex cognition and reliance on only one indicator can lead to misclassifications.";"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom"

We focus on one of these issues: the importance of measuring repeatability\nwhen attempting to quantify individual differences in cognitive traits, and the\ninterplay of individual variation with developmental processes. The\nrepeatability of results must be considered when quantifying cognitive\nabilities in order to ensure that among-individual variation results from\ncognitive factors rather than non-cognitive variables, such as motivation or\npersistence. We presented wild Australian magpies from 16 different groups with\ntasks designed to measure inhibitory control and spatial memory.

Subsequent testing at older ages will\nexamine this relationship further. Secondly, we compared cognitive performance\nwithin tasks and between tasks (carried out at the same age) to investigate\nrepeatability.

Preliminary video analysis suggests\nthat birds attended towards the white noise (duration of “immobility”, head orientation towards the amplifier) whereas they showed stress\nresponses in reaction to the distress calls (flying up, i.e. escape attempts, calls\nand higher levels of general locomotor activity). It also appears that birds\ncalm down earlier after hearing distress calls from a non-affiliate compared to\nan affiliate.

We exposed dominant breeders to warning\ncalls of former group members and unknown individuals, given towards perched\nhawks. Breeders immediately reacted to warning calls of former group members\nand escaped to safety. However, in response to warning calls of unknown\nindividuals, breeders were much slower in responding.

This work demonstrates polyandry effects on the probability of fertility at the onset of the mating season in a simulated ancestral population (with simultaneous male-female emergence, as opposed to [the current] protandric male emergence from hibernation). However, when fertility was assessed fertility in the current population, polyandry had no effect. Thus, assuming that polyandry is a costly behaviour (e.g., due increased predation, risk of sexually transmitted disease etc) something else must explain its persistence in the population. Lab experiments at the beginning of this research project showed that polyandry not only increased offspring viability at hatching but also offspring first-year survival (when mortality is at its highest). Since sand lizards are ectotherms, we then looked for environmental effects on adult courtship and mating behaviour and could confirm that during more benign conditions (warmer mating seasons) males were more active courting females, which resulted in more copulations per female and year, higher degree of multiple paternity within clutches, less malformations in the offspring, and higher offspring first year survival. Thus, we could confirm that our first lab experiments verifying positive polyandry effects on offspring viability were congruent with our observations on corresponding viability effects over a decade in the wild, comprising more than 5,00 adult and 4,000 offspring.";"The University of Sydney, Camperdown, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

By moving animals amongst institutions for prescribed breeding, these programs aim to promote demographic stability and preserve genetic variation. Yet many breeding programs are unsustainable. Often, prescribed pairs of animals are incompatible or reproductively unsuccessful. Outcomes of mate choice studies suggest that choosy females benefit from increased fecundity, litter size and offspring survival. Females have the ability to determine the male to which they are genetically best matched among available options. Thus, providing the opportunity to choose from several genetically appropriate potential mates might improve sustainability of captive populations.Assessing mate preference via odour before animal transfer is a proposed strategy for incorporating mate choice into zoo management. Chemical cues are important for mate choice in many mammal species – especially solitary carnivores – many of which are threatened with extinction. In this study, we sought to develop a protocol for testing the potential of incorporating mate choice decisions into breeding recommendations. We developed a test of female mate preference in American mink, a model carnivore. – Seventeen of 18 females showed a male preference during a four day stimulus (urine/faeces) trail. These females were subjected to a simultaneous partner choice test. Although mink females are polyandrous, paternity tests revealed that 13 females had offspring, which could be assigned to only one male. Nine of these females' male preference in the stimulus test correlated with the father of their offspring indicating that the females might base their choice on information from the stimulus trail. Altogether our results suggest that we might use urine and faeces samples from possible mates to reveal female mate preference. Therefore we are developing a method to assess female preference through urine presentation trials in carnivore species in zoos. This approach might reduce aggression between incompatible mates and the need for several introductions and ultimately increase breeding success and welfare in captive solitary carnivores.";"Research and Conservation, Copenhagen Zoo, Frederiksberg, Denmark"

We tested predictions of this hypothesis in the superb fairy-wren, Malurus cyaneus, by investigating long-term individual differences in risk-related behaviours and survival. We found consistent differences between individuals in their behaviour in a novel environment test, a captive setting likely to be perceived by wild birds as highly risky. Individual differences were consistent over several years and bi-variate analyses showed a significant among-individual correlation (‘behavioural syndrome’) between exploration behaviour at two life stages (young adult and old adult). Furthermore, docility at the nestling stage predicted exploration behaviour of juveniles. Behavioural traits measured in a risky context were correlated with one another, forming a behavioural syndrome of coping strategies ranging from ‘proactive’ to ‘reactive’. Nestlings that were more active and exploratory in isolation were less docile during handling, while adults that entered the artificial environment fast were more exploratory, active, and aggressive in the artificial environment. Exploration behaviour increased within individuals as they aged and when they were in poorer condition, consistent with expectations of more risk-prone behaviour with lower residual reproductive value (reduced ‘asset protection’). Risk-related behaviour predicted the probability of apparent survival: more exploratory individuals were less likely to be present in the population twelve months later. Our findings suggest that, consistent with the predictions of the POLS hypothesis, individual variation in survival is associated with consistent individual differences in risk-related behaviour that are maintained long-term and span developmental boundaries.";"University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"

For nocturnal, rock dwelling animals on sandstone outcrops, diurnal thermoregulation\nis limited to the selection of thermally suitable retreat rocks. As rocks are limited in number, there should be competition for quality retreat rocks. We used the flat rocks spider, Morebilus\nplagusius, a nocturnal, sit and wait predator on sandstone\noutcrops to determine if spiders use microhabitat selection as a form of behavioural thermoregulation for avoiding temperatures close to their thermal tolerances.

This is particularly problematic in tasks such as\nintercepting rapidly moving objects.  One\ncompensatory strategy is to use prior experience together with current sensory data\nto predict future visual state, so that actions can be planned ahead of time.\nHowever the role of such prediction in controlling interceptive movements is\nnot well established. There is substantial evidence for prediction in the\ncontrol of eye movements, although the basis for such prediction and its\npotential role in interception are unclear. We have developed a virtual\nracquetball environment and have examined predictive saccades while\nintercepting balls. We find that predictive saccades are a pervasive aspect of\nperformance. Subjects target a point on the trajectory of the ball, where it\nwill pass subsequent to a bounce, with high accuracy, and compensate for\nvariations in trajectory, velocity, and elasticity. This suggests that subjects\nuse learnt knowledge of ball dynamics to predict where the ball will be after\nthe bounce, and when it will get there. The complexity of the prediction rules\nout simple models such as visual interpolation or extrapolation. Instead,\nelasticity, 3D velocity, and gravity all are likely to be taken into account.\nSince eye, head, arm, and body movements all co-occur, it seems likely that a\ncommon internal model for predicting visual state is shared by different\neffectors to coordinate interceptive movements.";"University of Texas Austin, Austin, TEXAS, United States"

Owing to its central importance, decades \nof research have focused on predicting gaze locations, but there has \nbeen relatively little formal attempt to predict the temporal aspects of\n gaze deployment in natural multi-tasking situations. We study this \nproblem by decomposing complex visual driving behaviour into individual \ntask modules that each require independent sources of visual information for \ncontrol, in order to model human gaze deployment on different \ntask-relevant objects. This setting allows the characterization of \nmoment by moment gaze selection as a competition between active modules.\n To mediate this competition, we introduce a multi-particle barrier model for \ngaze selection that combines two key elements for each module: a priority parameter that \nrepresents task importance per module, and noise estimates that allow each \nmodule to represent uncertainty about its state of task-relevant visual\n information. The net effect is that each module attempts to reduce the \nreward-weighted uncertainty in its visual state information.

Components can be redundant, with each prompting similar\nresponse by receivers, or non-redundant, with each prompting different responses.\nFurthermore, the composite signal may have a similar meaning to one or both components,\nor a novel meaning. We used robot models to test the role of visual and vocal\nsignals in the multi-modal duets of Australian magpie-larks, Grallina cyanoleuca. Pairs produce\ncoordinated antiphonal vocal duets, which function to defend the territory, but\nthey also coordinate these vocal duets with visual duets, which usually entail\nalternating wing movements. However, there has been no study of this visual\ncomponent of display. We describe these multi-modal signals, and measure aggressive\nresponses by territorial pairs to each component independently, as well as to\nthe multi-modal signal. We assessed territorial aggression by the number of\nsongs and flights. Each sex had a repertoire of both song types and wing\nmovements. Partners rarely used the same song type within a duet, yet almost always\nused the same type of wing movement. Birds responded aggressively and equally\nto multi-modal and purely vocal duets, but less aggressively to purely visual\nduets, so that the visual component did not increase the perceived territorial\nthreat. However, surprisingly, birds gave more alarm calls to multi-modal duets\nthan to either vocal or visual duets. Our results imply that the vocal\nduet conveys the message to neighbours about territoriality, while the visual\ncomponent might just attract attention. However, the coordination of the type\nof wing movement within displays, independent of song type, indicates that the\nbirds must look at their partner during multi-modal duets. We therefore suggest\nthat the visual display may have a role in coordinating vocal duets within\npairs, analogous to a conductor’s baton, and so have a different audience.";"Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland"

Females usually choose potential mates on the basis of natural variation in the body colorations of conspecific males. Numerous studies have shown that a male’s body colorations influence female mating preference in vertebrates, but how natural variation of a male’s body colorations in invertebrate, particularly on spiders, affect female choosiness is relatively poorly understood. Jumping spiders have excellent vision, and males display brilliant body colorations, making them excellent models for studying the function of colour signals in sexual selection. In this study, we addressed the possibility that natural variation in male body colorations may contribute to female choosiness in a jumping spider Siler semiglaucus by presenting females with age- and size-matched conspecific males. By comparing female’s attention time towards paired males, together with quantified coloration of different male body parts, we were able to deduce whether females have preference for particular expression of male body coloration.";"National University of Singapore, Singapore, SINGAPORE"

Following this preliminary training, subjects were presented with several 4-item lists and required to learn them through the process of trial and error. This is an extremely difficult task in which chance responding would yield only a 0.9% success rate.

Using extensive mark-recapture, telemetry, and experimental translocations indicated that direct selection has constrained dispersal in Komodo dragons.  Despite impressive physical and sensory capabilities, this species almost always limited movement to within resident valleys indicating near complete dispersal restriction. Moreover stringent site fidelity was reinforced by lizards being hydrophobic  and insensitive to several basic drivers of dispersal evolution (e.g. inbreeding avoidance) that otherwise reduced survival.

"Melanie Massaro";"Sex-biased dispersal in an endemic island bird species     (#371)";"The risk of inbreeding is particularly high in small, closed, and isolated populations of island endemic species because there are few opportunities for gene flow to introduce novel alleles from other populations. One of the mechanisms that may facilitate inbreeding avoidance within populations is sex-biased dispersal, which results in close kin of the opposite sex not being in the same area for breeding. Here we investigated natal and breeding dispersal to determine sex-bias, post-dispersal breeding outcomes, and the effects of bird density on dispersal in the endemic Chatham Island black robin (Petroica traversi). Studies on island species in a closed environment where no immigration or emigration occurs, offer a unique opportunity to distinguish between emigration and mortality, which is a main challenge for dispersal studies. We found that natal dispersal in black robins was significantly female-biased in both proportion of birds dispersing and the distance dispersed. Bird density in the natal year increased the likelihood of juvenile dispersal of both sexes. Dispersal between successive breeding seasons was rare; when it occurred it was significantly female-biased in the proportion of birds dispersing but not in the distance dispersed. Regardless of sex, black robins were more likely to disperse after losing a mate, but females dispersed further than males after mate loss. Dispersal negatively impacted breeding success with dispersing black robins having lower breeding success post-dispersal than birds that did not disperse. This study suggests that sex-biased density-dependent dispersal – and not kin recognition – is the default mechanism that avoids pairings between close relatives in this species.";"Charles Sturt University, Albury, NSW, Australia"

Franklin’s ground squirrels are of conservation concern throughout portions of their range, while their basic ecology remains poorly understood. Field research on a Manitoba population of individually-marked, telemetry-collared Franklin’s ground squirrels near Delta Marsh, Manitoba revealed that females relocate their nest and litter to alternative burrows following parturition, likely incurring significant energetic costs and enhanced predation risk with each move. Telemetry data and direct on-site observation revealed that in the context of these moves, females transport their pups one by one, above ground up to four times throughout the course of lactation, sometimes over distances approaching a kilometer. We investigated the role of conspecific nest visitation, flea infestation, and nest habitat type as proximal factors precipitating nest movements. Females treated with insecticide to reduce flea infestation relocated fewer times than females receiving a control (water-only) treatment. Additionally, conspecific nest visits, registered with stationary Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT)-tag readers, increased the likelihood of movement within an observation day. Finally, nest occupancy was not independent of nest habitat type, suggesting habitat associations also play a role in nest selection and relocation. Significant effects of multiple factors suggest that nest movements evolved in response to myriad factors that impact female fitness. These findings offer novel insight into why lactating Franklin’s ground squirrel females undertake what superficially appear to be costly nest movements, enhancing our understanding of this under-studied and potentially vulnerable species.";"Department of Biological Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"

Recent evidence supports the RPM in Drosophila melanogaster, revealing a mechanistic link with the circadian clock.

Highly-social species in zoos can suffer from disrupted bonds and related impoverished welfare due to inappropriate social set-ups. The multitude of social species housed in captivity provides the behavioural researcher with an ideal opportunity to investigate what drives specific association patterns between individuals. And to determine if differing captive environments, between institutions, affect the type and patterning of social bonds present. Flamingos are extremely gregarious birds with a potentially flexible social system, occurring in flocks ranging from a few pairs to over a million individuals. The potential for important bonds to form between birds is therefore high, and past work on flamingo courtship behaviour supports the idea that assortment may affect health, welfare and fitness. As one of the world's most predominate captive species, flamingos are an excellent model species to test the effect of captivity on highly-evolved group-level behaviours. Here we present evidence to show that bonds between individual flamingos are stable and that birds actively assort outside of, as well as during, the breeding season. We show that courtship display performance, as well as aggressive characteristics (i.e. dominance) can affect the potential for information flow and connectivity between birds in a flock. We also explain similarities in social structure between zoos, as well as areas of husbandry (enclosure and flock size) that may alter the opportunities that birds have for developing preferential associations. The idea that flamingos can benefit from social support, and have an in-flock position based on physical attributes and behavioural characteristics, suggests we should consider birds' individualities when mixing flocks and managing groups.

We\ninvestigated how these correlated traits -- the glands, antipredator behaviors,\nsequestered prey toxins, and diet -- have evolved. Sixteen snake species\npossess similar organs, which are collectively called as nucho-dorsal glands. According\nto classical taxonomy based on morphological characters, the nucho-dorsal\nglands are observed in three nominal genera. In two of those genera, glands are\nfound in some species but not in others. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis\nrevealed that secondarily loss of the glands has occurred at least once, and probably\nseveral times. Furthermore, it is likely that the distribution of the glands\nalong the body (on only neck region or on the full length of the body) also\nexhibits homoplasy or reversal. In accordance with the loss or extension of the\nglands, unique antipredator displays also seem to have been lost or modified. A\nclade consisting of several species has shifted its primary prey from anurans\n(including toads) to earthworms. This dietary change seems to be related to changes\nin the chemical composition of the glandular fluid and possibly to the loss or\nextension of the glands. These results support the correlated evolution of\nrelated traits associated with the nucho-dorsal gland system.";"Kyoto University, Sakyo, KYOTO, Japan"
"Charline Couchoux";"Personality and the outcome of agonistic interactions for defence and access to resources in eastern chipmunks.     (#389)";"A complex dynamic of social interactions can be\ncreated when individuals are confronted with conspecifics. When animals defend aggressively\na spatial area and resources from intruders, the aggressiveness of the\nopponents is supposedly mainly related to the location where the agonistic\ninteractions occur. The growing interest in consistent individual differences\nin behaviour (i.e. personality) could, however, improve our understanding of\naggression and dominance, as it suggests the existence of individual variation\nin aggressive tendencies. Using only the proximity of individuals to their\nterritory to explain their propensity to win a contest could therefore not be\nsufficient to entirely explain the outcome of these agonistic events. We\ninvestigated these questions in the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), a small, and solitary, central-place foraging Sciurid\nthat actively competes for patchy resources, and aggressively\ndefends the area around its burrow. We\nrecorded multiple agonistic interactions among marked individuals that competed\nfor food resources experimentally supplied at different distances from their burrows.\nUsing a mixed-model approach, where both individuals were considered either as\nfocal or as opponent during a given agonistic encounter, we estimated the\neffect of individual variation in aggressiveness or in the tendency to trigger\naggression. Although the outcome of the contests was classically linked to the\nproximity of each individual's burrow, a great part of the variation was\ncaptured by the identity of the two interacting individuals. Individuals differed\nsignificantly in their tendency to overthrow their adversaries, thus showing\nconsistent aggressiveness. Furthermore, we found individual differences in\nreaction norms of aggressiveness as a response to proximity to the burrow. Considering\nindividual variation might therefore bring new insights to fully understand social\naggressive interactions, especially for territorial species. Measures of\nintrinsic individual aggressiveness corrected by the social context can also be\nused in a behavioral syndrome approach to investigate how they can be linked to\nother personality traits.";"Département des Sciences Biologiques, Université du Québec à Montréal, Montréal, QC, Canada"
"Christina Gruber";"Resource availability and predation risk influence fighting behavior and the maintenance of dominance hierarchies in crayfish     (#390)";"Dominance hierarchies, resulting from repeated agonistic interactions, reduce fighting and alter an individual's access to resources. Although the effect of size difference on the formation of hierarchies has drawn ample attention, few studies have investigated factors that may impair hierarchy maintenance. In the wild, major ecological factors, such as food availability and predation pressure, often vary substantially both spatially and temporally. However, little is known how cues from these ecological factors influence decision making of animals in contest situations, especially with regard to hierarchy maintenance.To examine the effects of resource availability and predation risk, we conducted repeated fight contests (three contests without manipulation, two with food and one with predation manipulation) between pairs of noble crayfish males, Astacus astacus. To be able to focus on the effects of ecological factors, we size-matched the opponents, since larger crayfish usually dominate smaller ones.We found that individuals achieving dominant status in non-resource contests had priority access to a limited, defendable food resource in a future contest. However, in the presence of a food resource subdominants decreased their submissive and avoidance behaviors but increased their percentage of winning, which may indicate an increase in their fighting motivation. In line with the asset-protection principle, individuals that had been dominant in a preceding non-predation risk contest increased their submissive and avoidance behaviors in the presence of a predation threat. This gave subdominants the chance to win a larger percentage of interactions in the predation risk contest than in the non-predation risk one.Generally, our results indicate that reversals in the dominance status can occur when contestants have similar fighting ability and that changing ecological factors may further contribute to hierarchy dynamics. Overall, our results suggest that ecological factors have to be taken into account to better understand the causes and consequences of dominance in nature.";"Department of Biosciences, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland"
"Claire McLean";"Male fighting ability predicts harassment of females and copulation success in the Lake Eyre dragon lizard     (#391)";"Dominance in male-male contests is\noften correlated with reproductive success. This may be because competitively\nsuperior males monopolise access to females, are preferred by females, invest\nmore into courtship or are more coercive. Differentiating these alternatives is\nessential to understand the interaction between male competition and female\nmate choice, and their influence on the evolution of male traits. We investigated\nhow male fighting ability relates to behaviour in inter-sexual interactions and\ncopulation success in the Australian Lake Eyre dragon lizard, Ctenophorus maculosus. We found that more\ndominant males have greater copulation success and employ a more coercive\nmating strategy. Males that harassed females more (with biting and chasing) also\ncopulated for longer, which may increase sperm transfer and/or fertilisation\nsuccess, and were rejected less by females. This is likely because females are\nunable to perform rejection behaviours (fleeing, lateral threat display or\nflip-over) while being bitten by males. Therefore, it appears that selection\nfor superior fighting ability in male contests also selects for aggression\ntowards females, which increases copulation success, generating mutually\nreinforcing selection. Females may gain indirect genetic benefits from mating\nwith dominant males that outweigh the costs associated with sexual coercion,\nthus maintaining the mating system.";"The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"
"Paulo Enrique Cardoso Peixoto";"Individual motivation is more important than fighting ability to determine contest settlement in the dragonfly Micrathyria ungulata     (#392)";"Although fights over territories are common in many species, there is little consensus about the factors that determine when the loser give up the contest. Empirical evaluations often focus on the effect of individual fighting ability or the effect of individual motivation to settle a contest. However, the lack of consensus may occur if both factors interact to determine the contest winner. In this study, we use males of the dragonfly Micrathyria ungulata to evaluate if i) individual fighting ability, ii) individual motivation or iii) an interaction between both factors determine individual investment in territorial contests. To evaluate these hypotheses we conducted a fight induction experiment. In this experiment, we simulated the approximation of a potential intruder in the territory to trigger a territorial defense response by both resident (marked males present in the territory for some days before the beginning of the experiment) and substitute males (marked males that occupied the territories after the removal of the residents). Resident males fought for more time against the potential intruder than substitutes. However, traits related to fighting ability (i.e. body mass, residual muscle mass and residual fat content) did not affect the time invested in fight by residents or substitutes. The fact that resident males fought for more time indicates that they are more willing to invest in fights (and consequently have higher chances to win natural contests), regardless of their physical or physiological attributes. If this effect is common across species, distinct motivations among individuals should increase variation in mean fight times among rival pairs. Consequently, because studies intended to evaluate how rivals settle contests often relate fighting times with individual traits, they may have difficulties in detecting patterns if there is no control for differential motivation among individuals.";"State University of Feira de Santana, Feira De Santana, BA, Brazil"

Interestingly, both during the acquisition and the\nuse of visual memories, insects - much like vertebrates - employ saccadic eye\nmovements, while stabilizing the roll and pitch orientation of their visual\nsystem, because the misalignment of views degrades the navigational information\ncontent of panoramic images (Raderschall et al. 2015).Ants, wasps\nand bees are central place foragers, which actively acquire visual location\nmemories of their nest or food locations during highly choreographed learning\nwalks and flights (reviewed in Zeil 2012). In both learning procedures, the\ninsects systematically scan the visual environment in a saccadic fashion, while\nat the same time carefully monitoring their position and orientation relative\nto the goal, so that each view is ‘tagged’ with the target location. It is this\nrelationship between learnt views and target location, which allows insects to\nsubsequently find back to places. When ant\nforagers are displaced, they scan the scene, before deciding on a heading\ndirection (Narendra et al. 2013, Zeil et al. 2014). The need for scanning most\nprobably reflects the ants’ inability to ‘mentally rotate’ their visual\nmemories and the fact that their visual fields are not fully panoramic.Zeil J (2012)\nVisual Homing – An Insect Perspective.

However, the compound eyes of invertebrates, offer one distinct and unique\nadvantage over the single lens eyes found in vertebrates: there is immense\nadaptive flexibility in the shape and size of their visual fields. As a\nconsequence, many invertebrates have evolved eyes with large visual fields and\nheterogeneous properties across the eye. Rather than produce sophisticated scanning\neye movements, the animals carefully align such eyes to the topography of the environment.\nThe solution is to look everywhere all the time. Like the eyes of many crabs, each fiddler crab eye has a full\n360 degree visual field that is carefully aligned with the predictable layout\nof their mostly flat environment. While such wide field vision necessarily\nleads to a relatively low visual acuity - reducing spatial detail - it removes\nthe need for eye movements and allows different regions of the eye to be\nadapted to different environmental and behavioural demands. In fiddler crabs, we\nhave found three distinct areas that directly link to the animal’s behavioural\ndemands. While often not as pronounced, such adaptations can also be found in\nvertebrates, such as fishes and wallabies for example. Even crabs, however, haven’t given up scanning eye movements\naltogether. Like flies, spiders and humans they appear to use small and fast\neye oscillations to improve their low visual acuity. Both these tactics -\npanoramic visual fields and micro scanning movements – offer interesting\nadvantages for artificial sensors and have been successfully applied to solve\nmachine vision problems.";"University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"

The\ninfluence of this treatment depended on feature size: birds were most strongly\ninfluenced by the asymmetrical pattern when stripes were intermediate-sized,\nand less affected by smaller- and larger-sized features.

Consequently, studies of visual processes in NM should not\nbe constrained by “mammalian / primate models”. We studied\neye use during visually guided behaviour in chameleons (Chamaeleo\nchameleon; Chamaeleonidae; Reptilia), as a NM model. In scanning the\nenvironment, chameleons perform large-amplitude eye movements, referred to as “independent”.\nWhen prey (insect) is detected, the eyes converge binocularly, “lock” in their\nsockets and visual tracking is by head movements. We asked: (i) How independent\nare eye movements? (ii) How related are movements to context? Chameleons, presented with two small targets, moving in opposite\ndirections, performed synchronous, smooth, monocular tracking. Similar to primate\nsmooth pursuits and saccades, tracking here comprised alternating “smooth”\nphases and abrupt “steps”, that differed between monocular and binocular states. In avoiding a moving threat, the chameleons\nperformed a highly precise, smooth counter-rotation of the body on the perch\n(gain = 1) achieving maximal concealment. Eye use during rotation was context\ndependent, with one eye fixating the threat and the other –scanning independently. We propose that eye movements in chameleons are not simply “independent”.\nRather, they are (i) independent during scanning, (ii) conjugate during\nbinocular tracking of small targets and (iii) disconjugate, yet coordinated,\nduring monocular tracking. These results\nsupport the view that basic monocular control is under higher levels of\nregulation that dictate the eyes' level of coordination according to context.

Our goal was to elucidate the effects of individual compounds found\nwithin SMW on locomotor activity of adult females in controlled laboratory\nsettings. Our results show that more than one compound is responsible for the changes\nin locomotor activity and pattern, and that the compounds that are effective\ndepend on the maturity stage of the female.

Given the dependency on sex\npheromones for successful sea lamprey spawning, we sought to exploit the pheromone induced responses of 3kPZS to\nfacilitate an effective and environmentally benign control strategy. We hypothesized that antagonists similar to 3kPZS will\ninhibit 3kPZS olfactory detection and disrupt behavioral responses of female\nsea lamprey. Candidate antagonists were identified by computationally screening\nmillions of commercially available compounds as analogs of 3kPZS that match a set\nof key chemical functional groups and docked well into the receptor structure. More than 300 candidate antagonists were tested via\nelectro-olfactogram for their ability to block olfactory responses to 3kPZS.\nSeven compounds blocked at least 50% of the olfactory response to 3kPZS. The\n3-hydroxyl analog of 3kPZS, petromyzonol sulfate (PZS), blocked 92% of the\nolfactory response to 3kPZS.

During the predation sequence, composed of the stages encounter, detection, identification, approach, subjugation and consumption, such defences should be deployed as the predator approaches, but before prey are brought under the predator's control (i.e. before subjugation). We tested this assumption in the mountain katydid (or bush cricket), which is cryptic at rest, but when disturbed flashes spectacular abdominal colours by lifting its wings, and is chemically defended. We experimentally determined which visual, auditory and tactile stimuli trigger their deimatic display via six treatments. Contrary to expectations of the predation sequence katydids required tactile cues before performing their deimatic display, that is, it was performed only after attempted subjugation. Field experiments also showed that katydids perform their deimatic display after experiencing tactile stimuli. Mountain katydid natural history may explain this  counterintuitive behaviour. Being slow and cryptic, katydids cannot effect a fast escape after performing their deimatic display but their tough cuticle and chemical defences make survival of initial subjugation attempts likely. Holding their deimatic display until after initial subjugation may prevent continued attack and avoid the potentially large cost of revealing themselves to predators that have not yet noticed them. Performance of deimatic display after subjugation may be more common than currently recognized and we encourage further investigation.";"School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Parramatta, VIC, Australia"
"Fonti Kar";"Why do winners keep winning? (24579)     (#814)";"Prior contest experience can influence the outcome of future contests. For example, an animal that loses a contest might be more likely to lose his next bout while a winner might be more likely to continue winning (winner-loser effects). However, the effects of prior contest experience may be highly dependent on the behaviors used during contests and whether they involved non-contact signalling or escalated to physical contact and biting. Where contests are resolved using ritualized displays, contest initiation—an animal’s readiness to engage, may be an important predictor of contest outcome because initiators appear more aggressive to their opponents. Conversely, in escalated contests, an individual’s willingness to engage and bite his opponent may be a more important predictor of contest outcome. We asked whether contest outcome in male Eastern Water Skinks (Eulamprus quoyii) is determined by previous contest experience and whether this is influenced by an individual’s behaviour and level of escalation. We staged contests using size-matched pairs in neutral arenas. We recorded which individual initiated the contest, the number of times an individual bit his opponent and whether the contest escalated or not. We predicted a priori that: 1.) winning increases the probability of initiating a contest and whether a male will escalate a contest; 2.) contest initiation will predict contest outcome in only non-escalated contests; and 3.) the total number of bites by a male will be an important predictor of contest outcome in only escalated contests. Our results supported our predictions and highlight the importance of contest-specific behavior in accounting for winner-loser effects. ";"Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University, North Ryde, NSW, Australia"

"Sonia Kleindorfer";"Female song increases predation risk: why females sing less than males     (#817)";"In general, the sexual selection paradigm has centred on choosy females and ornamented males. Given asymmetrical gamete investment, females (who per definition have high initial investment into large costly eggs) should prefer males (who per definition have smaller renewable sperm) that maintain costly ornaments. Song is a sexually selected trait and may be used by males to repel rivals and attract females. Little is known about the costs or functions of female song. Songbirds originated in Australasia and colonised the rest of the world, and it is likely that ancestral female songbirds sang. In extant species studied to date, female song occurs in 71% of species. Southern hemisphere songbirds generally do not migrate and many sedentary females and their pair males sing to defend the territory year-round. Southern hemisphere birds challenge classical assumptions about the evolution of sex differences in song. Given that song rate is under behavioural control, we test if song rate in female Superb Fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) changes across the nesting cycle and if high song rate increases predation risk. Our observational data show changes in male and female song patterns across the nesting cycle. Both sexes had highest song rate during the fertile period, uniparental females lowered song rate during incubation, both sexes had lower song rate during the nestling period, and both sexes increased song rate to fledglings. In pairs where female song rate was high, predation of eggs and chicks increased. Using artificial nests, nests with higher song rate had more predation. Our study provides observational and experimental evidence for behavioural changes in song rate that predict predation risk, and could explain why females that lay and incubate eggs sing less than males.";"Flinders University, Bedford Park, SA, Australia"
"Katharina Mahr";"Fashion Rules in Female Superb Fairy Wrens: Relationships Between Multiple Ornaments     (#818)";"Showy ornaments are considered as outcome of sexual selection processes. They provide a “badge of status” to impress conspecific rivals or potential mating partners. Elaborated ornaments could by themselves be attractive or signal aspects of  individual quality, but many species display not only a single, but a set of different ornaments. There are several hypothesis, explaining the existence of multiple ornaments suggesting that different ornaments serve as different information source, providing either additive or redundant information on the same quality aspect, or being simply evolutionary leftovers with no further relevant information.  Although, females of many species display elaborated traits, most studies regarding multiple ornaments focus on males. Given, that in many species females do also display multiple ornaments, the question about their functional significance arises.  To understand the existence of female multiple ornaments we investigated ornamental features of female superb fairy wrens (Malurus cyaneus), focusing on song and plumage characteristics. Female fairy wrens do sing complex songs, which they use in territorial defence, but they also have bright blue tail feathers. By examining the relationships between song and plumage colouration characteristics and relating them to fitness parameters we try to determine whether and to what extend existing hypothesis on multiple ornaments in males may be also applicable to females. Based on song recordings and spectrometric measurements including UV-colouration of tail feathers, we derived a series of different song and plumage parameters.Our results indicate interrelationships between song complexity and UV-colouration as well as green colour aspects in the tail. These results and their relationship to fitness parameters suggest that different traits do provide different information. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating multiple traits in female songbirds, raising the idea that multiple signalling of sexually selected traits is not restricted to males only.";"Konrad Lorenz Institute for Ethology, University of Veterinary Medicine , Vienna, Austria"
"Kristal E Cain";"Female song in the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus): song patterns across breeding stage and relationships with reproductive success.     (#819)";"Female song is widespread, and likely\nancestral. However, we currently know relatively little about when and why\nfemales sing, or what the fitness consequences might be for individual differences\nin song rates. Female song might function in female-male communication, or in\nthe context of female-female competition for reproductive resources. In either\ncase, song rates may be related to reproductive success. However, changes in\nresource availability may alter contest rules and the relationship between song\nrates and reproductive success. To address these questions, we quantified\nfemale song patterns across breeding stage, and determine how female song rates\nrelate to reproductive success, in two populations of superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus) that differ in habitat\nquality and population density. Female song rates were highly repeatable across\ndate and stage, and females sang more frequently than males in response to\nplayback of novel female song, but breeding stage had no effect on song rates\nin either sex. Further, we observed a marked population difference in female song\nrates, and in the relationship between song rates and reproductive success.\nFemales in high quality habitat sang less frequently overall, but females that\nsang more in response to playback had greater reproductive success. In\ncontrast, females in low quality habitat sang more frequently, but females that\nsang most occupied poor quality territories and had reduced reproductive\nsuccess. Together, these results indicate a strong role for female-female\ncompetition for resources rather than communication with males. The context dependent relationship between\nsong and fitness suggests that female song is an potential target for\nselection, but that resource availability can alter female contest rules and shape\nhow selection acts on female song. ";"Research School of Biology, Australian National University, Acton, ACT, Australia"

The face and voice are two such signals of the genetic and behavioural quality of potential mates. The present study uses a visual search paradigm to explore the cross modal effects of voices on the attention and perception of faces. The target stimuli were mathematically average female and male faces amongst an array of androgynous distractor faces. The auditory cue was a prototypical male or female voice. The vocal cues provided no information about the location of the face. It was predicted that sex-congruent voice/face conditions would produce a facilitation effect, whilst sex-incongruent conditions would produce inhibition effects. To account for individual variation in perception of androgyny, each participant’s point of subjective equality (point at which they perceive faces as androgynous) was calculated using a psychophysics procedure.

Unlike linearly polarized\nlight, circularly polarized light is not very common and the only animals known\nto have visual systems capable of detecting it are stomatopods1.A subsection of the complex retina of\nstomatopods is responsible for circular polarization vision2. In\nthis area the eighth retinular cell (R8) has the unique ability to act as a ¼\nwave retarder3. When circularly polarized light enters the eye\nand passes through these cells it is converted to linearly polarized light. The\nmain photoreceptor, which sits below the R8 cell, can now detect the light, as\nit is linear polarization sensitive2.Cell size is important factor in an R8\ncells ability to act optimally as a ¼ wave retarder. The length of the R8 cell\nand the width of the microvilli they are made up of are critical to its\nfunction4.

"Jennalee Clark";"Innate chemosensory recognition of predators in Port Jackson shark embryos     (#842)";"Innate behaviours are responses to specific stimuli due to the activation of developmentally encoded neural pathways. In marine environments, fishes exhibit innate predator recognition via detecting and interpreting chemical cues. Innate predator recognition is critical for optimal predator avoidance during early life history stages, when organisms are particularly vulnerable. Additionally, an ability to rapidly differentiate between non-predatory and predatory animals is crucial because it avoids wasting energy and time on futile anti-predator behaviours. Although studies have investigated innate responses of larval fish to predators, no studies have examined innate predator recognition in egg-laying elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays). As a result, it is unknown how encountering and interpreting chemical cues, produced by predators, will impact the embryonic development of elasmobranchs. The purpose of this study is to determine if Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) exhibit innate predator recognition during embryonic development and how this may impact their development.Viable Port Jackson shark eggs will be collected from Jervis Bay, NSW and used for laboratory-based chemosensory experiments. These involve introducing predator and herbivorous fish odours, as well as conspecific alarm cues to embryos and observing their responses. Heart rate will be measured before and after the introduction of chemical cues, by using ventilatory rates as a proxy for heart rate. An understanding of how predation pressure impacts embryonic development in egg-laying elasmobranchs may help to design conservation strategies that better protect H. portusjacksoni, and other species during early life history stages.";"Macquarie University, Frenchs Forest, NSW, Australia"

"Simone L Meddle";"Social behaviour and nonapeptide binding in passerine species of the Tibetan plateau     (#844)";"The Tibetan plateau presents a uniquely challenging environment for passerine birds and previous studies have demonstrated that several of these endemic species display particular social behaviour and seasonally variable hormonal profiles. Within the brain nonapeptides are strongly conserved across all vertebrate taxa and are known to influence social behaviour in a species-specific way and this is thought to be due to differences in nonapeptide receptors within the brain. Differences in nonapeptide binding have been previously reported for gregarious compared to territorial bird species birds (e.g. Goodson et al. 2006) but to date no studies have directly compared free living avian species in the non-breeding season when circulating sex-steroid levels are at their lowest.  We quantified aggression and collected brain tissue from wild free living white-rumped (Montifringalla taczanowski) and rufous-necked (Montifringalla ruficollis) Pere David's (Montifringilla davidiana) snowfinches in the non-breeding season in Tibet. Using simulated territorial intrusions we found that white-rumped snowfinches were more aggressive than rufous-necked snowfinches which are facultatively social. We used the [125I] ornithine vasotocin analog (125I-OVTA) to quantify and compare nonapeptide binding in the brain. The ornithine analog 125I-OVTA is widely used as a mesotocin receptor ligand but it also binds vasotocin. We found that white-rumped snow finches had higher nonapeptide binding in the lateral septum compared to rufous-necked snowfinches; no sex differences were observed in receptor density so the sexes were combined.  The lateral septum forms part of the social behaviour network in the brain with a role in regulating social behaviour such as aggression and our findings thus support mounting evidence for a role of nonapeptides in non-sexual social behaviour in birds.

"Alecia Carter";"Central baboons acquire and use social information more frequently in wild networks     (#847)";"Social information allows the rapid dissemination of novel information among group members and can provide animals with an alternative to collecting costly personal information about their environment. The social network can positively influence individuals’ access to social information. However, though individuals may collect social information through their network connections, whether they use the acquired information may be limited by their phenotype. Thus, to understand how individuals make decisions using social information, both an individual’s acquisition and use of social information should be considered concurrently. We investigated whether individuals’ acquisition and use of social information was determined by their social network position and phenotype. We quantified the proximity and grooming networks of two troops of wild baboons, Chacma ursinus. We experimentally introduced 50 novel food patches of a highly preferred food to baboons as they were foraging naturally to quantify individuals’ acquisition, use and successful exploitation of social information about the location of the novel food patches. Individuals who were more central—had more or stronger connections with others—in the proximity networks were significantly more likely to acquire and use social information, but were not more likely to successfully exploit the food patches. Centrality in the grooming networks significantly predicted the frequency of social information use and successful exploitation of patches, though the effect size was always small. Individuals’ phenotypes were also important, but not for information acquisition: males used social information more frequently than females, and successful exploiters tended to be bolder, higher ranked and male. Our results suggest that (1) individuals’ social environments are important for their access to social information but that (2) individuals are limited by their phenotypes in whether and how they can use socially acquired information and (3) alternative social networks may influence the acquisition and use of social information. We suggest that to gain a better understanding of information use in animals, both information acquisition and its use be considered in future studies.";"Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambs, United Kingdom"
"Jane Clothier";"Developing a Methodology for Measuring Stress Responses in Pastured Horses Using Salivary Cortisol Concentration     (#848)";"There has been recent discussion over the methods and limitations of salivary cortisol concentrations (SCC) for assessing stress responses in horses (Visser 2014). There are insufficient, or conflicting, data regarding circadian levels, variable basal levels between horses in a herd, and delayed secretion of cortisol into saliva. The majority of published studies involved stabled horses, which present as standardized subjects. However, positive stimuli within the normal stable routine, such as feeding and exercise sessions, that affect cortisol concentration have frequently been overlooked in experimental designs. We developed a study to determine the SCC response to stress trigger events in pastured horses, with a methodology taking these queries into account. The subjects were two unrelated, paddock-kept, unstarted geldings aged 4 and 7 years, which had shared a secure herd environment for 12 months. The horses had unrestricted movement and access to feed throughout the study period. SCC responses to a sudden 5-sec visual and auditory stimulus were assessed in both horses. Each received a single stress stimulus once per week, carried out approximately 2 h after the early morning SCC peak determined previously. Saliva was collected at 30-min intervals for 2 h post-stimulus. This regime was repeated once a week for 4 weeks. Both horses experienced a sharp increase in SCC following the trigger event, with peak concentrations at 60 to 90 min post-stimulus. Pre-stimulus SCCs ranged from 0.71 to 3.61 nmol/L (mean 2.00 ± 0.8 nmol/L).  Post-stimulus, peak SCCs ranged from 2.59 to 5.44 nmol/L (mean 4.19 ± 0.9 nmol/L). In conclusion, equine responses to sudden stress triggers can be quantified with SCC assay, but knowledge of the subjects’ underlying basal levels is important in order to properly interpret the results. Timing of sample collection should be adjusted according to circadian peak periods, and to accommodate the delayed peak in SCC.";"Agriculture, CSIRO, Armidale, NSW, Australia"
"Maria Ericsson";"Domestication effects of early postnatal stressor exposure on HPA-axis reactivity and behaviour in chickens (Gallus gallus).     (#849)";"Domestication may have changed fundamental aspects of the stress response, as has previously been found in adult chickens (Gallus gallus). Severe or chronic stress can lead to immediate and/or long term alterations on behaviour, as well as decreased efficiency of the immune system, decreased reproductive success and increased stress sensitivity. Similarly, short- and long-term phenotypic changes has been observed when exposing early postnatal individuals to stress. Previous work in chickens has demonstrated immediate behavioural changes after stressor exposure at an early age, and also a dampened HPA-axis response. The aim of this study is to present a coherent view of the postnatal development and reactivity of the HPA-axis during the first 3 weeks of life together with behavioural responses in a domestic layer breed and in its ancestral breed, the Red junglefowl. By measuring the recovery behaviour after the exposure to an acute stressor, combined with HPA-axis reactivity we aim to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects and underlying mechanisms behind the changes after an acute stressor exposure. The preliminary results show a significant change in baseline corticosterone as well as in HPA-axis reactivity to stress during the first 23 days of life in both Red junglefowl and in layers. Domestication effects were seen on baseline corticosterone levels on day 1 and 23, and a significant difference in HPA-axis reactivity was seen on day 23. So far, we conclude that the HPA-axis of the chicken is reactive from day one post hatch and that it is still maturing and stabilizing during several weeks, and that the development differs between the breeds.";"IFM Biology, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden"
"Takahiro Kato";"Nest site competition frequency increases embryo mortality in the tree sparrow     (#850)";"The tree sparrow passer montanus has lower egg hatching rate than other birds. In previous study, I found that unhatched eggs showed no sign of embryo development, in particular, male embryo failed to develop. Also, breeding density negatively affected embryo development success. These indicate that any factor resulted from breeding density impaired developing male embryo. Here, as one of the factors, I focus on nest site competition frequency. I predicted that nest visits of nest site competitors increases embryo mortality. I attached nest boxes in Ogata village, Akita prefecture, Japan. On the day 2nd or 3rd egg was laid, I recorded number of nest visits of the competitors for 3 hours in the morning. As a result, I found that increasing nest site frequency was negatively correlated with embryo development rate significantly. Moreover, I measured parent behavior; spending time on the nest box and number of nest visits as nest guard behavior. In the consequence, female parent which spent short time and often visited laid many undeveloped eggs. Additionally, when nest site competition was intensely, female parents showed more nest guard behavior. Such female parents might be in high stress level which has negative effect for offspring survive. Furthermore, brood sex ratio should be biased to female because most of mortal eggs were male. In summary, nest site competition frequency affected female parent behavior, maybe grow stress level, and thus male embryos failed to develop embryo. This suggests that secondary sex ratio could be skewed in according to nest site competition frequency.";"Evolutionary Studies of Biosystems, SOKENDAI, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan"

However, whether fish behaviour can acclimate or adapt to elevated CO2 over multiple generations remains unanswered. We tested for transgenerational acclimation of reef fish olfactory preferences and behavioural lateralization at moderate (656 μatm) and high (912 μatm) end-of-century CO2  projections. Juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, from control parents (446 μatm) exhibited an innate avoidance to chemical alarm cue (CAC) when reared in control conditions. In contrast, juveniles lost their innate avoidance of CAC and even became strongly attracted to CAC when reared at elevated CO2 levels. Juveniles from parents maintained at mid-CO2 and high-CO2 levels also lost their innate avoidance of CAC when reared in elevated CO2, demonstrating no capacity for transgenerational acclimation of olfactory responses. Behavioural lateralization was also disrupted for juveniles reared under elevated CO2, regardless of parental conditioning. Our results show minimal potential for transgenerational acclimation in this fish, suggesting that genetic adaptation will be necessary to overcome the effects of ocean acidification on behaviour.";"James Cook University, Douglas, QLD, Australia"

This is a problem when the\npopulation is one we wish to conserve, but should be a blessing when the\npopulation is an unwanted invasive. For example, some social insects are highly\ninvasive pests, threatening agricultural services and the environment. Social\ninsects also tend to be highly susceptible to inbreeding depression due to\ntheir haplo-diploid sex determination system, in which individuals homozygous\nat the complementary sex determiner, csd\n(i.e. diploid males) either do not survive to adulthood or are infertile as\nadults. We investigate the consequences of inbreeding in a recent social insect\ninvasion in Australia: the Asian Hive Bee (Apis\ncerana). We first test the conjecture that today’s invasive population\narose from a single founder colony arriving in Cairns in 2007. We then determine\ncsd diversity of colonies sampled\nthroughout the timeline of the invasion (2007 to present). Finally, we consider\nthe role that thelytoky – a form of asexual reproduction in which unmated\nqueens or workers produce daughters – has played in the spread of A. cerana’s population.

The free-contact keeping method involves both\npositive and negative reinforcement, where the keeper and the elephant share\nthe same space. Protected-contact involves the keeper having contact with the\nelephant through a protective barrier. The aim of protected-contact is to\nincrease keeper safety and eventually eliminate the need for negative\nreinforcement.This study examines the\npotential implications to the welfare of the elephants over time after the\nshift from free-contact to protected-contact, by measuring a range of welfare\nindicators, including response to keeper commands (including the use/frequency\nof positive and negative reinforcement), general behaviours (ethograms), vocalisations,\nexercise, body condition, foot health, compliance with medical treatment, and\nstress measured through cortisol levels in faeces. Data will be presented on how these indicators varied across\nthree separate 24-day periods over the 14 month study.These findings will provide insight into how the\nanimals responded to the change in keeping method and address any changes that\nmay have had an adverse effects on the elephant’s welfare.

Historically, this has been\nconducted under a free contact system and the elephants have been used in\nvarious visitor engagement programmes such as rides, shows and public feeding\nsessions. In early 2015, WRS announced plans to phase out the free contact\nmanagement, converting to a protected contact (PC) system. While the five\nelephant cows will still be managed in a free contact program until adequate PC\nfacilities are built, a first step towards the implementation of PC management\nwas to discontinue all direct visitor interactions. With this, the animals have\nbeen spending more time together as a herd and informal observations over the\nlast two months have already revealed changes in the group dynamics.In the future PC\nsystem, physical contact between humans and animals will be constrained and the\nmanagement will no longer rely on the trainers sustaining social dominance over\nthe elephants. Positive reinforcement with target training will be the main\nmethod used for training and animal managers will not be able to physically\nintervene in the event of disputes occurring between the elephants. It therefore became\nimportant for us to monitor the changes in the social dynamics within the group\nas they progress towards becoming a socially compatible herd, as well as\nbetween the elephants and the trainers. This allows us to anticipate potential\nsocial problems and explore protected contact techniques that can be used to\nmitigate such issues.

(#863)";"Oral necrobacillosis,\nalso referred to as ‘lumpy jaw’, is a well-recognised cause of morbidity and\nmortality in captive macropods worldwide. It is distinguished by alveolar\nosteomyelitis of the mandible and/or maxilla, with associated inflammation,\ncausing the characteristic appearance of lumps to the jaw. Treatment for lumpy\njaw is often invasive and unsuccessful, with a low post-therapy survival rate. The\nassumption is that the increased occurrence of lumpy jaw in captivity is due to\nanimals being exposed to stressful environments brought about by management\nprocedures. Techniques to reduce stress and disease are routinely included in\nhusbandry and management practices yet the findings from zoo reports indicate\nthat these procedures may have a causative role to play in disease outbreaks. These\npractices also have an influence health, well-being and behaviour, ultimately\nimpacting upon host immunity, leading to outbreaks of disease such as lumpy\njaw. However, the\nbehavioural response to management techniques in captive macropods is largely\nunknown and could prove to be a useful tool in identifying factors within their\nenvironment that cause stress, and subsequently, disease. To encapsulate an\namplified global perspective, studies of captive macropod behaviour and\nenclosure utilisation will be performed in zoos across Australia and Europe.\nAnalyses of behavioural responses to housing and husbandry, in relation to\ntheir lumpy jaw status, aim to identify factors within the captive environment\nthat may predispose macropods to the disease.

Capability, mechanism and ontogeny of orientation in the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata     (#864)";"Knowing\nthe current position with respect to an intended goal, the orientation\ncapability, is essential to perform homing. Social insects constitute an excellent system for studying these phenomena. To check whether the forager wasps can orient\ntowards their nests if experimentally dislocated, we released foragers of\ntropical primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia\nmarginata in several distances from their nests without providing food and\nrecorded their vanishing bearing. When released near their nests, they did not\nhead towards their nest. However when released further, even from completely\nnovel sites, surprisingly they oriented towards their nests. When food was given\nto the wasps prior to release near the nest, the paradox was solved as they headed\ntowards their nests. This happened because when released near to their nests\nwithout food, instead of heading towards their nests, wasps might have gone for\nforaging. But when released further, wasps might have preferred to reach near\nthe nest first and so, they headed towards their nests. This result indicates\nthat the forager wasps can orient towards their nest irrespective of their\nfamiliarity with the release site and its distance from their nest. Further investigation\nshowed that they rarely perform orientation flight when released near\ntheir nests, but when they were transported far from nest, radial orientation flight constitutes\none of the key mechanisms of orientation. It thus appears that the wasps orient\nthemselves with the help of surrounding landmarks when they are visually familiar\nbut switch to other methods of orientation when they find themselves in unknown territory. To study\nthe ontogeny of orientation capability we focused on the orientation flights at their nests, of\noutgoing and incoming wasps of known age.

We can\nobtain knowledge of macaque social cognition by investigating how individuals\nuse greeting calls to smoothing their social interactions.In many\nanimal species, post-conflict situations are associated with increased\nmotivation for opponents and bystanders to engage in affiliative interactions.\nThis is because affiliative interactions can reduce post-conflict anxiety. However,\nthere is individual uncertainty about initiating such interactions. Specifically,\nboth victims and bystanders may be uncertain about whether post-conflict behaviors\nof former opponents are affiliative or antagonistic. We predicted that greeting\ncalls would be used to reduce uncertainty and anxiety.We observed aggressors and victims in naturally occurring\nconflicts and control situations. We recorded whether monkeys emitted greeting\ncalls or not when initiating affiliative interactions.

Both aggressors\nand victims were more likely to emit calls when interacting with less familiar\nindividuals. These findings indicate that monkeys use greeting calls when\nuncertainty is high. Self-scratching rates showed a greater decrease after\naffiliative interactions with greeting calls than after interactions without\ncalls.

Fish are widely used as model organisms for personality research due to the utility of breeding and housing them in a laboratory, as well as the ability to collect fish from numerous diverse habitats2 . Despite hundreds of studies on personality in fishes, there remains a striking lack of research on personality in elasmobranchs. Like other heritable traits, personality is subject to evolutionary selective pressures, and given their extensive evolutionary history, it is unlikely that personality has been evolutionarily stagnant in elasmobranchs3 . As top predators, elasmobranchs play crucial roles in mediating prey behaviours and food web interactions; thus understanding the influence personality has on elasmobranch behaviours, such as food preferences and spatial use, is key to managing overall ecosystem health4,5 .

The “Snowdrift-Game” has been proposed as a model to\nunderstand how organisms coordinate and make decisions under conflict\nsituations. By investigating whether and how chimpanzees solve these dilemmas\nwe can gain insight into the mechanisms of cooperation. We presented pairs of chimpanzees\nwith two different Snowdrift games. In Experiment 1 subjects could provide\nequal food rewards to themselves and a partner by pulling a weighted tray in\nhigh and low weight trials either by pulling simultaneously and share the load\nor free-riding (letting a partner pull ), with the risk that if both tried to\nfree-ride the food was lost. In Experiment 2 subjects were faced with an\nunequal reward distribution paradigm. Similarly to Experiment 1, in the\ncritical condition the higher reward was acquired by letting a partner act with\nthe risk that if neither acted the rewards would be lost.In both experiments chimpanzees\nwere highly successful at solving the dilemma. They almost never lost the\nrewards because at least one partner was willing to pay the cost (increased\neffort in Experiment 1 or decreased rewards in Experiment 2) to avoid\ncoordination failure (no reward). In Experiment 1 chimpanzees solved the game\nby pulling together in 70% of trials. They were more likely to cooperate in\nhigh cost (high weight) condition, but cooperation in this situation was also\nlikely to be more unequal (one partner invested more effort). In Experiment 2,\nsubjects waited longer for their partner to act when this would lead to a\nhigher reward. These results suggest that\nchimpanzees strategically adjust their timing and actions to maximize their\npayoffs while maintaining successful coordination.";"Developmental and Comparative Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany"

Cooperative\nBreeding theory (CB) contains a number of hypotheses which attempt to explain\nthis behaviour. However a general explanation has remained elusive, despite\nnumerous studies on various terrestrial taxa. One major obstacle is a\nlack of studies on marine fishes, which show remarkable diversity in social strategies.\nTo address this knowledge gap, I used CB as a\nframework to study the evolution of sociality in a group of coral reef fishes\nof the genus Gobiodon. I conducted a large-scale in-situ comparative\nstudy to lay the foundation for experimental tests of CB. First, I developed a\nsocial index for each species of Gobiodon at Lizard Island. The length\nof each fish was measured, as well as coral size, to\ninvestigate whether these factors predicted sociality. Second, I compared\nthe level of ecological constraints experienced by both asocial and social\nspecies to test one of the key hypotheses of CB, known as the Ecological\nConstraints hypothesis. This hypothesis examines the idea that the costs\nof dispersing due to ecological pressures make it more preferable for an\nindividual to delay its dispersal and thereby refrain from independent\nbreeding. To examine this hypothesis, transect counts of groups of\neach Gobiodon species were usedto compare group\nsize, habitat size and habitat saturation. The majority of species with high\nsocial indexes had significant relationships between group size\nand habitat size. Analysis of the habitat saturation data is currently\nunderway. Examination of differing characteristics between species with high\nand low social indices may provide insights into the evolution of sociality in\nthese fishes.  This study provides evidence that social species\nof Gobiodon are ecologically constrained in the maximum sizes\nthat their groups can attain and is an important first step toward revealing\nhow sociality may have evolved in Gobiodon species. ";"School of Biological Sciences, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"

We investigated how hatching\nsequence and nestling sex influenced the growth and development of nestlings in\nthe cooperatively breeding Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala, a bird that lives in large, complex social\ngroups with female-biased dispersal of offspring. Overall, offspring growth\nrates, expressed as body mass gained during the linear growth phase prior to\nfledging, were best explained by hatching order and offspring sex. In contrast,\nskeletal growth was primarily affected by other factors such as the brood's sex\nratio, with nestlings raised with smaller female siblings having a faster\ngrowth rate than those raised with larger male siblings. Significant sex differences were apparent in nestling growth; male nestlings had a higher growth\nrate and a larger pre-fledging body size, potentially indicating a greater cost to raise.  Earlier-hatched nestlings also grew at a\nfaster rate, regardless of their sex, and achieved a greater pre-fledging body\nmass than later hatched young. Overall, our findings suggest that early life\ndevelopment in noisy miners is heavily influenced by both hatching sequence and\nnestling sex, probably through within-brood competition and higher investment in\nphilopatric males than dispersive females, leading to potential conflict in\nbrood allocation patterns between helpers and breeders in this obligately\ncooperatively breeding system.";"Avian Behavioural Ecology Laboratory, Zoology, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia"
"Shona Duguid";"Do chimpanzees make sure others can see what they are doing when they need to cooperate?     (#890)";"Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) cooperate with group members in a variety of ways, such as group hunting and boundary patrolling. In order to do this successfully they need to coordinate their actions with others and one possible way to coordinate is to use communication (such as gestures and vocalisations). However, previous experimental studies with captive chimpanzees suggest that communication does not play a significant role in coordinating their actions. Therefore we were interested in alternative strategies chimpanzees may be using to coordinate; namely, whether chimpanzees take into account what their cooperative partners can see and use this to aid coordination (an ability they have demonstrated in studies using competitive paradigms). To address this question we presented captive chimpanzees with a pure coordination problem. In order to access food rewards two individuals were required to choose the same one of four options. The decisions of the two individuals were made sequentially so that the second individual could respond to the decision of the first (and thus release rewards for both of them). In the test situation a barrier blocked visual access to two of the options for the responder (but not the initiator). Thus, to be certain of success, the initiator should make their choice visible to the responder. We contrast this with a competitive version, in which the responder can steal from the initiator. In this case we would expect the initiator to hide their decisions to reduce the possibility of stealing by the responder. The results of this study will be discussed in relation to the mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviour in chimpanzees.";"Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, SACHSEN, Germany"

Additionally, some corvid species such as ravens exhibit a range of\ncooperative behaviours including the formation of strong affiliative bonds\ncharacterized by frequent food sharing, preening and agonistic support. Using a\nrevised method for measuring prosociality which disentangled motivation to\nprovision a conspecific from motivation to feed next to one, we presented\ncaptive ravens (Corvus corax) with a low-cost prosocial choice task in which subjects received nothing for themselves, but could\nchoose between a tray that delivered food to a conspecific or one that delivered\nfood to an inaccessible, empty compartment. After first meeting criterion to\nensure that they understood the experimental setup, each bird was tested with\ntwo different partners that varied in terms of their affiliation to the subject.\nTest trials were interspersed with motivation trials. Our results show that subjects\noften inhibited pulling on trials when they received nothing for themselves,\nand both the absolute number and proportion of subjects’ prosocial choices did\nnot differ significantly from chance.

By means of this model and data from\nnatural guppy populations, we investigate whether social networks of wild\nguppies support cooperation theoretically, and whether the predicted\ndifferences in support of cooperation between high and low predation\npopulations are present. We also investigate the role of specific structural\nand dynamical network features for the maintenance of cooperation in the guppy\nsystem.

Chimpanzees and bonobos are differing on several types of\nbehaviours such as social tolerance and stress reactivity, which are thought to\ninfluence expressions of prosociality [1, 2].

The level of cognitive complexity underlying such helping is\nadditionally examined. More specifically, if the helpers are able to\ndemonstrate a self-other distinction, hence, understand that the other might\nneed a different tool to the one currently needed by themselves.

Our current knowledge of social evolution in vertebrates, however, has primarily come from bird and mammalian studies. Despite being largely understudied, reptiles remain an important piece of the puzzle in our study of social evolution; they represent a major class of vertebrates and, similar to mammals and birds, many are gregarious. Increasing our understanding of sociality in reptiles is important given that it would allow for comparisons across phylogenetically distinct vertebrate classes. In this study, we investigated the social structure of the eastern water dragon, Intellagama lesueurii, and found that males and females showed both preference and avoidance for members of either sex. Furthermore, we found sex differences in the extent of individual sociability: females generally formed stronger associations with one another than any other sex class (e.g. male–male, male–female). Although association patterns correlated to some extent with home range overlap, we found no evidence of a correlation with kinship.  Overall, our study presents additional evidence that sociality can evolve outside the realm of kin selection.";"University of the Sunshine Coast, Nambour, QLD, Australia"
"Ayaka Takimoto";"Inequity aversion in horses (Equus caballus)     (#897)";"Humans dislike inequity if they receive more than another individual and also if another individual receives more than themselves. Such a negative response to inequity has supported the evolution of cooperation by helping an individual to choose a fair partner for cooperative interaction (Brosnan, 2011). Recent studies have demonstrated that several nonprimate animals also show elaborate cooperative behaviors and are averse to inequity. However, very few studies have been conducted. In our study, we investigated whether domestic horses are sensitive to unfair situations and react to inequity negatively. The procedure was similar to that of Brosnan & de Waal (2003), with a modified task for horses. In the fair condition, both a partner and a subject touched a target to receive a pellet (a low-value food) when given a visual and auditory command by a human experimenter. In the unfair condition, a piece of carrot (a high-value food) was given to the partner by the experimenter (no exchange), and then the subject was given the command to touch the target for a pellet. In the expectancy control condition, the partner was absent and the subject witnessed a piece of carrot being shown in the location where the partner normally was, after which the subject was given the command to touch the target for a pellet. The subjectsâ reaction times were significantly longer in the unfair condition than the fair and control conditions. Moreover, horses also performed more indirect approaches to the target in the unfair condition compared to the fair and control conditions. These results suggest that horses were slower to perform the task and adopted a more indirect strategy when unfairly rewarded compared to the fair and control conditions. This is the first experimental evidence of inequity aversion in ungulates.";"The University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"

While several studies in recent years demonstrated\nthat synchronous actions increased cooperation in later tasks, the aim of the\ncurrent experiment was to investigate whether an initial cooperative\ninteraction also led to more behavioural synchrony in a later unrelated task.\nWe asked randomly paired, same-gender dyads to solve a jigsaw puzzle either\ntogether or each person by themselves.

Most\nresearch on cooperative behaviour has been dedicated to understand its adaptive\nfunction.

Here we present estimates of repeatability and heritability of\ncooperative behaviours in Neolamprologus\npulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish. In this species subordinates\ncarry out alloparental brood-care tasks, for instance cleaning a clutch and\ndefending it against egg predators. N.\npulcher subordinates differ both in the amount of helping and in the helping\ntasks they perform. First, we determined repeatability, i.e. the\nwithin-individual consistency of helping behaviours over time, as this\nparameter sets an upper limit to heritability. Second, we estimated\nheritability of helping behaviours, i.e. the proportion of the additive genetic\nvariation of the phenotypic variation, to assess the potential of natural\nselection acting on these behaviours. We show that the estimates of repeatability\nof such cooperative behaviours are generally substantial but differ between\nbehaviours: While egg care is highly repeatable, egg defence behaviours show\nintermediate repeatability. However, the heritability estimates for these\nbehaviours are very low. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address\nthe genetic basis of complex animal cooperative behaviour. Our analysis of\nvariance components suggest that the high within-individual consistencies of\nhelping behaviour over time are predominantly due to environmental effects\nwhile additive genetic variance has rather small effects. Since the number of\nhelpers in N. pulcher groups varies\ngreatly in the wild, we hypothesize that low heritability but strong environmental\ninfluence on the cooperative tendencies of offspring might facilitate the flexible\nadjustment of the amount of help needed in the territory.";"Institute for Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern, Switzerland, Hinterkappelen, BERN, Switzerland"

In this study, we 1) estimated vulnerability by quantifying chick survival throughout the pre-fledging period, and 2) simultaneously quantified changes in parental aggression throughout the nesting cycle. We found that chick survival probabilities were lowest during the first 10 days of life and that a peak in parent nest defense intensity matched that stage.

In species under\nhigh predation pressure it seems advantageous to shorten a risky nesting period\nand to reduce parental activity at the nest. It can be achieved by a strategy\nthat shifts allocation of resources between growth and endothetmy. Shortening\nof the nesting period may be achieved by rapid body growth in poikilothermic\nnestlings with the minimum possible feedings, and the onset of endothermy at a\nbody size enabling them to leave the nest. As a result, the frequent feedings\nnecessary for maintenance of warm-blooded young would be constrained to a short\nperiod. Such an optimal strategy would reduce both parental cost of\nreproduction and the risk of predation. In the present study we tested the energy allocation hypothesis in the\nBlackcap Sylvia atricapilla, a small\npasserine suffering from high nest predation. We analyzed the relation and trade-offs\nbetween nestling growth, development of thermoregulation and feeding rate. Our\nfindings revealed that Blackcap nestlings were characterized by rapid growth\nbut they achieved only 80% of their mature weight prior to fledging. Body mass\nshowed highest relative growth rate before nestlings achieved homeothermy. The\nonset of endothermy, indicated on day 7, coincided with 90% of nestling\nfledgling weight, indicating that the two processes are separated in time. A strong\nnegative correlation between feeding rate and growth rate demonstrated that\nBlackcap nestlings develop their bodies under relatively low feeding rates and\nmore feeding is needed for maintenance of body temperature than for body\ngrowth. The study indicates the high cost of endothermy for parents -\nendothermic nestlings received over 100% more feedings than ectothermic ones.

The aim of the present study was\ntherefore to shed further light on this intriguing issue by studying the ontogeny\nof social and spatial independence in two bonobo (LuiKotale and Wamba, DRC)\nand two chimpanzee communities (Taï South, Côte d’Ivoire; Kanyawara,\nUganda). We had two questions: First, do social interactions emerge at\ncomparable time points in bonobos and chimpanzees? Second, does spatial\nindependence develop similarly in bonobos and chimpanzees? To answer these\nquestions, we investigated interaction rates and play behaviour as well as mother-infant\nbody contact and proximity. The behaviour of twelve chimpanzee and twelve\nbonobo infants was recorded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nduring\n1200 and 600 hours of observation respectively,\n\n\n\n using a focal/time sampling protocol, which resulted\nin a total of 8562 sample points. Our results showed that\nconspecific interaction rates of bonobos increased compared to those of\nchimpanzees during the second year of life. In addition, bonobo infants showed\na higher frequency of social play while chimpanzee infants engaged more often\nin solitary play involving objects.

We analyzed\nthe temporal features of successive vocalizations in human infants and juvenile\nBengalese finches, one of the songbird species. We used three temporal parameters;\nNote duration (ND; vocalizations with expirations), Inter-onset-interval (IOI;\nbetween the onset of the preceding note and the onset of the following note) and\nInter-note-interval (INI; silent period without any vocalizations). These\ntemporal parameters might be related to the intentional vocalization with\nrespiratory control.

We investigated the integration of adult zoo as well as re-socialised ex-laboratory chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) by focusing on close proximity and grooming behaviour using social network analysis (SNA).We compared individual social network measures of three groups of ex-laboratory chimpanzees at the Primate Sanctuary at Gänserndorf, AT to that of two groups of zoo chimpanzees at Burgers Zoo and Dierenpark Amersfort, NL. The ex-laboratory chimpanzees  experienced either early (EDs, n=10) or later (LDs, n=8) deprivation from their mothers and single caging for decades. The zoo groups comprised wild-born maternally deprived “founder” individuals (MDs, n=9) as well as non-deprived (NDs, n=16) animals. If age at onset of deprivation affects later social integration we expected social network measures to differ between individuals with traumatic experiences during early childhood, i.e. EDs and MDs, and later deprived as well as mother-reared ND individuals. If, however, duration affects social integration ex-laboratory chimpanzees are expected to differ from zoo chimpanzees. Our study revealed that proximity networks were most strongly affected by the duration of deprivation as ex-laboratory chimpanzees were much more selective regarding their association with partners subsequent to re-socialization than were zoo chimpanzees. However, ex-laboratory chimpanzees partially recovered during the second year of group life. Grooming interactions, in contrast, appeared to be more affected by the age of onset of trauma since MD chimpanzees were less well integrated in grooming networks than their zoo born and mother-reared ND conspecifics. Network measures of these founder chimpanzees were comparable to those of ED chimpanzees, even after living sometimes more than 40 years in the stable zoo groups. Thus, our data suggest that early traumatic experiences as well as lack of social experience affect social integration of chimpanzees throughout their lifetime.";"Department of Zoology, Karl-Franzens University, Graz, Austria"

Bold behaviours often co-vary with contest behaviour and outcome, although there is evidence that the structure of these behavioural syndromes can change across situations. Aggression itself is typically repeatable, but also subject to high within-individual variation as a consequence of plastic responses to previous fight and outcomes opponent traits. Common proximate mechanisms may underpin variation in both contest behaviour and general personality traits. Given the theoretical links between the evolution of fighting and of personality, with the possibility that both are driven by negative frequency dependent selection, longitudinal studies of contest behaviour, combining behavioural and physiological data, should be a useful context for the study of animal personalities.";"University of Plymouth, Plymouth, DEVON, United Kingdom"
"Alex McQueen";"Can adaptation to background colours explain the evolution of bird colour diversity?     (#400)";"Animal colouration is one of the least understood components\nof phenotypic variation. Colours may be conspicuous – demanding the attention\nof rivals or mates – or they may be cryptic, allowing animals to remain\nundetected by predators or prey. The degree to which colours are conspicuous or\ncryptic is influenced by their contrast against a background. Variation in\nbackground colours and differences in habitat use could therefore promote the\nevolution of diverse animal colours. If colours are adapted to their\nbackgrounds, cryptic colours should be less – and conspicuous colours more –\ncontrasting if seen against commonly used, relative to unused, backgrounds. We\ntested these predictions in a community of Australian woodland birds by\ncomparing the contrasts between plumage colours and the backgrounds of used and\nunused microhabitats for foraging, nesting and display. Although, in general,\npatterns of plumage-background contrast followed our expectations for cryptic\nand conspicuous colours, the average differences in contrast were small and\nrarely statistically significant. We conclude that while selection for optimal\nbackground contrast may explain colour variation in some species, it has\nlimited potential to comprehensively explain colour diversity at the community\nlevel.";"School of Biological Sciences, Monash University, Clayton"
"Herbert Hoi";"Females produce more colourful eggs when males sing faster: My males song turns me on!      (#401)";"Maternal investment can play an important role\nfor offspring fitness, especially in birds, as females have to provide their\neggs with all the necessary nutrients for the development of the embryo. It is known that this type of maternal\ninvestment can be influenced by the quality of the male partner. In this study\nwe first verify that male song is important in the mate choice of female Eurasian\nreed warblers, as males mate faster when they sing more complex. Furthermore,\nfemale egg investment varies in relation to male song characteristics. Interestingly,\nclutch size, egg weight or size, which can be considered as high-cost\ninvestment, is not influenced by male song characteristics, whereas comparably low-cost\ninvestment types like investment into diverse egg components are adjusted to\nmale song characteristics. In line with this, our results suggest that female\nallocation rules depend on investment type as well as song characteristics. For\nexample, egg white lysozyme is positively correlated to male song complexity.\nIn contrast, a negative correlation exists between song speed and syllable\nrepetitiveness and egg yolk weight as well as egg yolk testosterone\nconcentration. Thus our results suggest that female egg investment is related\nto male song performance in several aspects, but female investment patterns regarding\nvarious egg compounds are not simply correlated.    ";"University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, AUSTRIA, Austria"

The sensory and psychological traits of signal receivers\ncan act as selective pressures that drive the evolution and design of visual signals.\nHere, we investigated whether particular components of conspicuous warning\nsignals (colour, pattern, borders) improved learning that a prey item was\nunprofitable by marine predators, and also which cues they paid most attention to\nwhen making generalisations about novel visual stimuli. To do this, we conducted\nbehavioural experiments in aquaria with our model fish predator, the Picasso\ntriggerfish (Rhinecanthus aculeatus).\nFish were trained to approach and tap at different coloured stimuli to either\nreceive a palatable or unpalatable food reward. Visual stimuli were designed\nbased on those displayed by nudibranchs (sea slugs). These shell-less molluscs\nuse conspicuous colours and patterns to warn predators they contain toxic\ncompounds, which they sequester from their sponge diet. We designed our\ncoloured stimuli based on Chromodorididae nudibranch colour patterns, many of\nwhich have a yellow border, with red or blue highly contrasting internal\npatterns. We found that the external yellow border strengthened avoidance\nlearning by predators, and this was also an essential component of the signal\nfor fish to make generalisations between learnt colour patterns and novel (but\nsimilar) colour patterns.  These results help\nexplain variation within internal patterns of nudibranch signals both within\nand between species, as avoidance learning seems to be achieved through the highly\nconserved yellow border.

"Amanda M. Lea";"Irrational mate choice: decoy effects in the túngara frog     (#426)";"Mate choice is one of the most important decisions an animal makes and it promotes the evolution of some of the most elaborate traits in nature.  Mate choice models derive from traditional microeconomic decision theory, implicitly assuming that individuals behave rationally by maximizing their Darwinian fitness, the logical evolutionary analogy to economic utility(1).  Rational choices exhibit the property of regularity, requiring that the relative strength of preferences between objects remain stable when additional options are available.  Human consumers routinely violate this assumption(2-3) and there is evidence that nonhuman animals make irrational foraging decisions(4-5).  The long held assumption of rationality in mate choice, however, has yet to be rejected.  Here we show that female frogs reverse their mate decisions in a systematic manner known as a “decoy effect,” violating the axiom of regularity and therefore the assumption of rationality in mate choice.  We tested preferences for three mating calls in which their total subjective value to females was a function of static acoustic characters and the rate at which the call was presented.  In binary choice tests, the females’ preferences for these three stimuli were transitive and favored stimulus B (B>A, B>C, A>C).  In trinary tests, in which C is by definition the inferior decoy, females’ preferences showed a significant change in preference from B to A, whether the females could actually choose the decoy or only hear it.  Decoy effects in mate decisions reveal that the relative valuation of two mates is not independent of inferior alternatives in the choice set and therefore cannot be explained with rational choice models such as those we currently utilize for understanding mate choice.";"University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TEXAS, United States"
"Amod M Zambre";"Foraging plasticity facilitates persistence of an obligate corallivore butterflyfish on disturbance-prone reefs     (#121)";"Climate induced mass bleaching causes large scale coral mortality resulting in reefs that are poor and patchy in resources. This severely affects obligate corallivores like butterflyfish that show rapid declines subsequent to bleaching events. Although patterns and mechanisms of declines are relatively well understood, little is known about how resilient obligate corallivores manage to persist on bleached reefs. To explore this, we compared foraging behavior of a resilient obligate corallivore Melon Butterflyfish Chaetodon trifasciatus across three atolls in the Lakshadweep archipelago with similar pre bleaching coral cover and communities that suffered differential bleaching in the wake of 2010 El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO). Our results indicated that densities of C. trifasciatus did not show any clear trend with respect to coral cover. However, foraging behavior varied considerably between atolls, with individuals at low-coral cover atolls a) spending more time traveling between resource patches b) compensating for decreased foraging time by increasing intake rate during each foraging bout and c) becoming considerably less selective of the coral genera they eat. This foraging plasticity is likely crucial for the persistence of coral obligates in sub-optimal environments subject to repeated coral declines. Understanding such species-specific responses to bleaching is critical to understanding how species interactions are likely to change, and to be able to predict fish community assembly in the wake of increased frequency of climate disturbances.";"Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore"

We found no difference in the exploratory behavior of cadmium-treated fish and water-treated controls, when those fish were tested in pairs. In the context of a larger group of 6 fish, however, we observed a striking difference. Groups that contained a pair of cadmium-treated fish approached and remained near a novel stimulus more than did groups containing a pair of water-treated control fish.

"Nozomi Nishiumi";"Look before you leap: Jump after the initiation of snake strike increases probability of successful escape      (#408)";"To avoid\npredation, many prey animals remain motionless, which enhances crypsis. It is\ngenerally considered that once predator detects the immobile prey, the\nmotionless state loses the function of crypsis, and thus the prey should not\nremain motionless because allowing predators come close simply makes prey\ndifficult to escape. Contrary to this expectation, frogs often remain\nmotionless even when they are detected by predator snakes, and the frogs\ninitiate fleeing at a closer distance. To reveal possible advantages of the\nresponse, we conducted field observations to comprehend the situation of\npredation event of them. According to the observed situation, we conducted staged\nencounter experiments using frogs and snakes to examine factors that affect\nsuccessful escape of frogs, especially focusing on strike behavior of snakes in\nclose quarters. From the field observations, it was confirmed that the predation\nevents between frogs and snakes are settled within a few seconds because of\nmuch safe zone for frogs around the predation event. In the experiment, video\nanalysis revealed that snakes are not able to change the course of strike after\ninitiating it, and not able to move in a split second after the strike behavior.\nThus, it was demonstrated that frogs are able to evade the snake strike with a\ncertain distance, and letting snakes to initiate strike and evading it is\neffective to make snakes pause in a split second that allows frogs to escape\nsuccessfully. In conclusion, flight initiation of frogs after initiation of\nsnake strike may increase the probability of successful escape, and thus, waiting\nfor strike of snakes until they closely approach can be an adaptive decision\nthat results in head start.

"Rebecca Wheatley";"Predation strategies: predicting optimal running speed when there is a trade-off with manoeuvrability     (#409)";"Ecologists\nhave traditionally used maximum performance as an indicator of the likelihood\nof task success. However, this is not always the case: individuals do not necessarily\nneed to be able to outrun a predator using their maximum speed, and may instead employ tight turns to outmanoeuvre it and escape. The functional performance\ntrade-off between speed and manoeuvrability means that the faster an individual\nruns, the less manoeuvrable it becomes. Selecting the optimum running speed\nbecomes a matter of finding the perfect balance between these two performance\ntraits for a given situation. We would expect animals to evolve toward their\noptimum performance in tasks where the stakes are high. However, whether\nindividuals choose to perform at this optimum in different ecological settings is\nlikely to be dependent on a variety of physiological and environmental factors. Our\nwork uses optimality modelling to predict the optimum running speed when there\nis a trade-off with manoeuvrability in a native insectivorous marsupial, the\nbuff-footed Antechinus (Antechinus\nmysticus). We then use experimental tests to determine whether Antechinus choose\nto employ this optimum speed in different\necological settings, where they act as either a predator or a prey species.\nThese kinds of trade-offs offer explanations as to why seemingly unintuitive\nbehaviours are exhibited in the natural world.";"University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia"

These results show that white sharks have sufficient behavioral flexibility to exploit fluctuating environmental features when predating.

Against\nthis backdrop, a century of work on the sensory worlds of bees has led to their\nemergence as a highly tractable system for the study of multimodal integration\nfrom both proximate and ultimate perspectives. Not only are their visual and\nolfactory worlds relatively well-characterized, but we can also\nstraightforwardly manipulate features of bees' developmental environment\nrelevant to sensory processing.

Aposematic organisms display warning signals\nthat are coupled with some form of unprofitability, for example chemical\ndefences; they are therefore thought to have multi-modal displays. Wood tiger\nmoths (Parasemia plantaginis) are aposematic and, against theoretical\npredictions, display either white or yellow colouration in their hindwings\nthroughout most of their distribution range; one possible explanation for their\nco-existence is that yellow males have a more efficient warning signal (the\ncolour itself) whereas white males have a more efficient secondary defence. Chemical\ndefences in wood tiger moths are of two types: secretions from their thoracic\nglands and abdominal fluids; one likely explanation for the existence of these\ntwo types of defences is that they are targeted to different enemies.

In the Non-helper condition, the actor turned away and refused to\nhelp the owner. In the Control condition, the actor simply turned away in the\nabsence of any request from the owner for help. A neutral person always sat at\nthe other side of the owner throughout these interactions. After the\ninteraction, the actor and the neutral person each offered a piece of food to\nthe dog. Different groups of dogs received 4 test trials in one of the three\nconditions. Dogs chose food randomly in the Helper and the Control conditions,\nbut were biased against the actor in the Non-helper condition. Importantly, the\ninteraction between the owner and the actor involved a neutral object, not\nfood, in which dogs showed little interest. Therefore the dogs’ avoidance of\nsomeone shown here who behaved negatively to the owner suggests a type of image\nscoring.

The\ntopic of intentionality has been of interest since the scholastics and received\nmuch attention in philosophy starting with Brentano who marked intentionality\nas the hallmark of the mental.

While\ncognitive sciences aim to find intentionality as well as goal-directed\nintentions in humans and animals, criminal law had to introduce a functional\ndescription in order to deal with criminal intent, mental capacity, and\ndiminished responsibility. Comparative ethology is trying to find a\nformalization of the concept in order to be able to investigate intentions\nempirically in animals. Different disciplines have working and functional\ndescriptions of intent that might help cognitive ethologists to formalize the ability\nto have goal-directed intentions for non-linguistic animals.

We used spatially explicit individual based simulations to investigate\nthe effect of mate sampling on the intensity of sexual selection and its long\nterm evolutionary effects. We observed that an increase in the number of males\nsampled by each female promotes an increase in the intensity of sexual\nselection, as measured by both Imates and selection gradient. We\nalso ran evolutionary simulations in which females had unbounded preference for\nlarge male trait values, whereas males were under stabilizing natural selection\nfor that same trait. As a result, an increase in the number of males sampled by\neach female promoted more exaggerated male traits after 50 generations. The\nconsequences of mate sampling may explain why lekking species are those with\nthe most exaggerated male ornaments, since male aggregations allow females to\nsample a large number of males.

This surprising lifespan extension effect has been\ndemonstrated in numerous species across diverse eukaryotic taxa, but we are\nstill a long way from understanding what drives the response and what, if any,\nis its evolutionary significance. A prominent hypothesis suggests that the\nlife-history responses to DR evolved as an adaptive strategy whereby resources\nare redirected from reproduction to somatic maintenance, to promote survival\nduring resource scarcity. In line with this idea, it has been proposed that DR\nanimals may adaptively reduce activity rates and mating behaviours, such that\nlifespan extension could be due in part to reduced wear and tear and avoidance\nof hazards, like predation and exposure to injury. However, evidence for this\nidea has been equivocal, and available data has come only from laboratory\nstudies, in which hazards are largely absent and behaviours are likely to be\nconstrained by the artificial environment. Here we present new data from a study\non the water strider Gerris buenoi,\nin which we show that DR applied in a semi-wild environment, although reducing\nreproduction, fails to elicit the extended lifespan or reduced ageing responses\nthat are well documented in the same species in the lab. This suggests that the\nlifespan extension effect of DR is likely to be a laboratory artefact, rather\nthan an adaptive response to resource scarcity that evolved in early eukaryotes.\nMoreover, we show that while diet drives some behavioural differences in mating\nrates, foraging rates and refuge use, DR does not appear to reduce exposure to\npredation, as reinforced by autopsy data.

"James Dale";"The effects of life-history and social selection on male and female plumage coloration     (#430)";"Animal ornamentation is typically more pronounced in males. Classical sexual selection theory predicts that males obtain greater fitness benefits than females through multiple mating because sperm are cheaper to produce than eggs. Sexual selection is therefore expected to lead to the evolution of male-biased secondary sexual characters. However, this generality has been challenged by recent studies which have emphasized that in many species females are also highly ornamented. Although, the evolution of male-like ornamentation in females is often considered a correlated genetic response to strong sexual selection on males, an alternative view is that female ornaments evolve under social selection to signal quality or status in the context of male mate choice or female competition for resources. Here we resolve this issue by analysing plumage coloration in both males and females of all ~6000 species of passerine birds (Aves: Passeriformes) and determining the main evolutionary drivers of its ornamental elaboration. Using a new method to quantify coloration, we show that socio-ecological predictor variables have a stronger effect on female than on male coloration. Colour elaboration is strongly predicted by 1) large body size, 2) “slow” life-history strategies associated with tropical breeding and 3) sexual selection on males. However, sexual selection has antagonistic effects on male and female coloration, and we show that the well-established link between sexual dichromatism and male-biased sexual selection is mostly due to reductions in female-, rather than increases in male-, ornamentation. Our results indicate that female colour elaboration is not only a correlated response to selection on males, but instead directly reflects variation in female signalling needs.";"Massey University, North Shore City, AUCKLAND, New Zealand"
"Kensuke Nakata";"Female genital mutilation and monandry in a spider, Cyclosa argenteoalba     (#431)";"The evolution and the ecological consequences of mating systems of animals, including human, has been studied extensively. Monandry, in which a female has one mating partner, could be established and maintained in two ways, i.e., 1) when a female spontaneously refrains mating with multiple males, and 2) when a partner male interferes re-matings of a female that otherwise tries to mate with other males. In the latter case, the interference that is realized by several mechanisms, such as guarding, mating plug or injecting chemical substances, is often incomplete, and the female can escape from the partner males to mate with other males. This may explain the reason why polyandry is ubiquitous in animals.Genital coupling is necessary for successful copulation, and damaging female genitalia is expected another possible way to limit the number of mating partner of females. Spider is a candidate group that may use female genital damage to realize monandry, since in some species, female genitalia is found partly mutilated.I examined this hypothesis using an orb-web spider, Cyclosa argenteoalba, by staged matings and artificial mutilation experiments. Females of C. argenteoalba accepted two palpal insertions in one mating bout in most cases. They were deprived of a small genital appendage (a scape) after the second palpal insertion of their first matings. This mutilation completely took copulation ability from the female that was still eager to re-mate. The mutilation rate was high and more than 90 % of females were forced to lifetime monandry. This mechanism is considered to provide great advantages to males in sexual conflicts over mating number of females. The occurrence in female genital mutilation may be widespread in spiders.";"Kyoto Women's University, Kyoto, KYOTO, Japan"

This species exhibits delayed plumage\nmaturation, with subadult (1st year) birds lacking the gaudy red\nplumage of adults. We observed more non-infected breeding pairs than expected\nby chance, but found a lower than expected frequency of cases where both sexes\nwithin a pair were infected. Infected males were rarely observed breeding, but infected\nfemales were often paired with uninfected males. Moreover, we found clear age-dependent\npairing in males; unlike females, sub-adult males rarely bred and females never\npaired with a male younger than themselves. In both sexes, prevalence and viral\nload were lower in older age classes, but patterns of infection among pairs remained\nconsistent when accounting for age-dependent infection. In addition, parental\ninfection status did not explain nestling infection status, suggesting that\nother infection routes (e.g. from the nest material) are likely in this system.\nThe rarity of finding infected breeding males could be explained by female\nchoice for non-infected males or by the reduced competitiveness of infected\nmales. We discuss the potential for age-related\ninfection by parasites or other pathogens to mediate age-dependent mating.\nAdditionally, our findings have implications for managing outbreaks BFDV and\nother pathogens in endangered species.";"Deakin University, Geelong"

In only the\nhigh temperature groups, growth rates of subordinates decreased as the size\nratio between themselves and their immediate dominant approached 1.0, whilst\ngrowth rates of dominants were unaffected. This unique finding suggests that only\nunder high temperatures subordinates may adopt growth regulation to resolve\nconflict, when the costs of conflict with dominants are greater.

We investigated nest-site selection following failed\nnesting attempts in an endangered endemic New Zealand passerine, the Chatham\nIsland black robin Petroica traversi.\nPrevious work has shown that almost all nest predation on robins is by introduced\nEuropean starlings (Sturnus vulgaris)\nbut that predation risk is reduced in\nlow versus high nests, and in open versus cavity nests.We tested whether black robins (i) increase the distance between\nfirst and second nests when the first has been depredated, (ii) build\nreplacement nests lower after predation, and (iii) are more likely to change\nnest substrate (cavity or open nests) following nest predation. We found that black\nrobins built replacement nests at a greater distance from depredated first nests than from successful first nests, but they\ndid not either nest lower or change nest substrates. This suggests that although\nblack robins recognise nest failure due to predation, and respond by building\nreplacement nests away from the area, they do not appear to link the predation\nevent to particular nest site characteristics. In other species, the absence of\nsystematic changes in nest site selection following predation has been\nattributed to diverse and unpredictable predator threats. Given evidence for\nthe relative safety of particular nest site features in black robins, and the\npresence of a single predator type, this argument does not appear to explain\nthe results of the current study. Instead, we suggest these findings may\nreflect predator naivety in black robins, which did not evolve with the\npredation risk posed by introduced starlings.";"School of Environmental Sciences and Institute of Land, Water and Society, Charles Sturt University, Albury, NSW, Australia"

However, no\none has yet tested whether gregarious fish species assort according to\nphysiological characteristics like metabolism and whether this assorting\naffects the group’s escape behaviour.

The flow regimes for each collection site were measured on six\nrandom days over a three-week period. The metabolic rate (standard metabolic\nrate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS)) of eight\nrandom individuals from each school were measured using intermittent-flow\nrespirometry. The group’s escape behaviour was then tested in a laminar flow\nswim tunnel, in which the school’s response to an aerial stimulus was recorded\nin high-speed (240 fps). We found evidence of assorting by metabolism within\neach of these schools, with greater similiarities found within schools than\nbetween schools. Schools with a higher aerobic scope exhibited more effective\nescape responses, with a faster latency time and greater turning rate in\nresponse to the stimulus. Though SMR was independent of flow rate, the other\nmeasures of metabolism (MMR and AS) and escape performance all increased in\nschools from a high-flow regime reef. These results suggest physiological\nassorting is occuring on the reef, though further studies are needed to\ndetermine if this is occuring due to passive or active mechanisms. This\nphysiological similiarity among fish within a school has effects on the escape\nbehaviour of the group, with escape performance improving with higher aerobic\nscope and flow in the school’s home reef. ";"James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia"
"Douglas J Emlen";"Extreme animal weapons: The importance of duels     (#442)";"Many animal species face intense reproductive competition, with males battling rival males for opportunities to mate with females.  Occasionally, the intensity and nature of reproductive competition can lead to the evolution of extravagant weapons – disproportionately large mandibles, antlers, horns, tusks, or legs – that aid males in battle.  Although these species are relatively rare, they include some of the most fantastic and exaggerated examples of animal form.  Examining the behaviors and natural histories of heavily armed species, and comparing these with related species lacking big weapons, hints at the ecological circumstances likely contributing to the evolution of extreme weapon sizes.  Escalated weapon evolution appears most likely when animals depend on limiting resources that are localised and economically defensible, and when fights over these resources unfold on or in substrates that restrict access to guarding males, structuring male-male encounters so that they tend to occur as a succession of duels, rather than multi-male scrambles.  Duels, long recognised by military historians as an essential prerequisite for arms races, have been almost entirely overlooked by behavioral ecologists.  I suggest this critical aspect of agonistic male encounters comprises the crucial missing ingredient for explaining a diversity of extreme sexually selected animal weapons. The combination of (1) intense reproductive competition, (2) limiting, localised resources, and (3) one-on-one contests, appears a potent formula for rapid evolution of extraordinary weapon sizes.";"The University of Montana, Missoula, MONTANA, United States"

"Christina J Painting";"Weapon polymorphism in arthropods: novel cases of multiple weapon morphs within single species     (#444)";"Animal weapons are typically possessed by males that use these exaggerated traits to fight with other male competitors and increase reproductive success. The expression of weaponry is often highly variable among individuals, and in many species morphs are divided between large (armed) and small (unarmed) males in accordance with one or more developmental thresholds. These thresholds that divide males into discrete morphs are condition-dependent and strongly associated with body size, such that small-bodied males typically lack big weapons and rely on alternative behavioural tactics to gain access to females for copulation. Recently we conducted a behavioural and morphometric study of Pantopsalis cheliferoides , a harvestmen (Arachnida: Opiliones) from New Zealand. Male P. cheliferoides  possess extremely exaggerated chelicerae which are highly variable in length among individuals. Across the same body size spectrum, however, some males belong to a distinct second exaggerated morph which possesses short, broad chelicerae, which were also found to be used as weapons. Remarkably, we discovered a similar pattern in an unrelated brentine weevil (Cephalobarus macrocephalus; Coleoptera: Brentidae) highlighting the possibility that multiple weapons forms in other animals may be prevalent. We will address the implications of these findings, especially with regards to our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of developmental thresholds and weapon polymorphism.";"Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore"

Here, using DNA-based methods, we investigated the effects of feeding degrees and seasons on the diet of rural free-ranging domestic cats. First, we evaluated the detection of food item DNA by amplifying a cytochrome b minibarcode from collected faeces of a housebound cat fed a known diet and by sequencing amplicons using two next-generation sequencing (NGS) benchtop platforms (Ion Torrent PGM and Illumina MiSeq) to validate our approach. Prey DNA was better detected than DNA associated with anthropogenic foods and the sensitivity of detection of food items differed according to NGS platforms. Then, we used DNA metabarcoding on 359 a priori cat faeces collected during three sessions and combined results from the two NGS platforms. Simultaneously, the producer of faeces was identified by comparing individual microsatellite genetic profiles from faeces and fur samples of outdoor cats fed ad libitum (n = 86) and farm cats irregularly fed (n = 68). Of collected faeces, 90.8 % were confirmed to be that of domestic cats. At least one food item was determined in 81.9 % of the investigated faeces, and 14.4 % of the producer of faeces were assigned with genotyping. A total of 24 different prey taxa were identified, with 93 % until the species level. Rodents were most frequently eaten by cats (90.1 %), followed by birds (9.5 %). Microtine voles (Arvicola terrestris and Microtus arvalis) occurred preferentially in cat diet. During the cool season, the consumption of preys by outdoor cats was significantly lower than the one of farm cats, while it did not differ during the mild season. Feeding degree and weather influenced cat predation.

These eye-catching color displays are frequently associated with strong chemical defences, but how such defences and conspicuous displays coevolve is frequently unclear.  Here, we present comparative data on colour patterns and chemical defences in a wide range of nudibranchs, which are soft-bodied gastropod molluscs. We quantified colour patterns from a potential predators perspective using visual modeling and pattern analysis, and also conducted a systematic chemical survey of secondary metabolites from a range of nudibranch species. We then examined the relative strength of these chemical defences against a range of predators. To date, we have found evidence that aposematic nudibranchs have evolved from cryptic, relatively undefended species; however, species that have the strongest visual signals do not necessarily have the strongest chemical defences. Empirical data on the relationship between conspicuousness and the strength of chemical defences in a wide range of species has enabled use to explore key evolutionary hypotheses on the evolution of aposematism.";"The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD, Australia"

We conducted an observational study of the orb-web spider Gasteracantha fornicata that has discrete (human-perceived) yellow and white morphs. We combined data on light environments and prey captures collected at fine temporal scales with visual modelling, to explore the chromatic and achromatic conspicuousness of spiders from the perspective of their predominantly fly prey. Our results show that at the times at which prey are captured, yellow individuals are disproportionately chromatically contrasting against their backgrounds (compared to all other times of the day), whereas white individuals show disproportionate achromatic contrast when capturing prey. Further modelling suggests that yellow and white signals are designed to enhance chromatic and achromatic conspicuousness, respectively, in the heterogeneous light environments that G. fornicata inhabit.

We also found a correlation with simulations of the Stokes parameter U contrast channel and the measurement of the same channel in the bigeye scad.

Thermal benefits of color change depend on an animal’s absorptance of solar energy in both visible and near infrared (NIR) wavelengths, yet research has focused almost exclusively on the former. Here, we show that wild-caught bearded dragon lizards (Pogona vitticeps) exhibit substantial UV-visible and NIR skin reflectance change in response to both background colour and temperature, both in the laboratory and in the wild. Biophysical models of heat transfer confirmed a significant potential thermal benefit of colour change. In the laboratory, lizards changed colour exclusively on their dorsal body regions in response to temperature; but both dorsally and ventrally in response to social interactions. Furthermore, in the wild, background colour explained much more of the observed variation in the colour of lizards than did body temperature. Thus bearded dragons are able to partition dorsal and ventral colour change to accommodate the competing requirements of thermoregulation and signalling respectively; but may prioritise camouflage over thermoregulatory requirements in the case of dorsal coloration, particularly if there is a conflict between the two.  Lastly, we found that the relationship between UV-visible and NIR reflectance change varied substantially within and between individuals, particularly in response to temperature. This raises the intriguing possibility of adaptive modulation of NIR reflectance, as a consequence of trade-offs between thermoregulation and signalling or camouflage.";"The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"

Debris-throwing behaviors\nare also performed during den maintenance with no other octopus near the region\nwhere the debris is thrown. In order to establish targeting, it is necessary to\nexclude the hypothesis that cases where another octopus is hit by debris are\naccidental, perhaps due to a routine act of den-cleaning being performed in a\ncontext where a nearby octopus has the den-cleaner's attention. We discuss a\nrange of observations that may discriminate the hypotheses of targeted and\nnon-targeted throwing, including differences in the style of debris-removing\nbehaviors seen in the presence and absence of another octopus. We also discuss the possibility that targeted throwing is an instrumentally conditioned learned behavior specific to a context of unusually high densities.";"CUNY Graduate Center and University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

One of the resources they process with those tools are cashew nuts. During the maturation changes, the cashew nuts turns easier to crack, because when dry (late season) the husk became more fragile. We know that some wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) adjust their selection of tools according to the properties of the processed nut, using harder (stone) tools when the nuts are harder, and softer (wood) tools when the the nuts are dry and easier to crack. We think this same process could happen to the capuchin monkeys at Serra da Capivara National Park. We tested if the cashew nut properties (fresh x dry) change the selection of tools by those monkeys. The capuchins use stone tools to open both fresh and dry nuts as part of their natural foraging behavior. Our results show that capuchins used significantly larger tools to process fresh nuts, and males selected larger stone tools than females. The number of hits used to open a nut was influenced only by the hammer size (fewer hits with larger hammers), for fresh and dry nuts. We found that these capuchins adjust the selection of stone tools to different maturation stages of cashew nuts.

However, despite this broad applicability, the study of social networks is currently limited by both a strong focus on pattern analysis as well as a lack of dynamic interaction models. Here I will show a dynamic modelling approach that can be used to capture the responses of fish social networks to changing environments. We found that fish maintain specific network characteristics across different types of habitat manipulations and that some of these characteristics (such as network positions) are unique to a given network. We also found that in contrast to habitat manipulations, social manipulations produced strong, albeit short-lived, changes in network dynamics. Furthermore, I will discuss the underlying evolutionary constraints that shaped these networks dynamics and identify some of the ecological consequences of such network dynamics. Finally, our model of the social behaviour of fish can be embodied by interactive robots (that are accepted by live fish as a conspecific) which allows experimental tests of transition dynamics across social networks.";"Humboldt University, Berlin, BERLIN, Germany"

In turn, on a\nbehavioural time scale empirical evidence also shows that parents negotiate\nover parental care, modifying their efforts in response to the effort provided\nby their mates. Although theoretical explorations suggest that sexual conflict\nand negotiation should reduce parental care, and as a consequence parental and\noffspring fitness, a recent model (Johnstone et\nal. 2014; Behav.Ecol. 25:216-222) proposes that alternation\nof the provisioning visits as a negotiation rule can help to overcome this and\nlead to a cooperative and more efficient level of parental care. This turn-taking\nmechanism implies that each parent monitors its partner’s behaviour.

"Teagan Gale";"The ‘late Bruce effect’: Exposure to a novel male during late pregnancy influences subsequent growth, behaviour and development of offspring     (#554)";"In mammals, allocation to reproduction can either be primed or\nsuppressed in relation to cues from other individuals. The presence, odour and\nbehaviour of conspecifics (e.g. potential mates) may enhance an individual’s\nability to reproduce but others may have a detrimental effect on reproductive\nsuccess. One widely studied response to conspecific cues, the ‘Bruce effect’,\noccurs when pregnant females abort their pregnancies after exposure to a novel\nmale. It has been suggested that this response has evolved as a counter-tactic\nto the threat of infanticide posed by novel males. In some species, like mice,\npregnancy termination will only occur if females are exposed to the unfamiliar\nmale during a brief critical period early in pregnancy, which is surprising\nconsidering that an unfamiliar male threatens infanticide whenever present, and\nin particular near to birth. We demonstrate that female mice experiencing novel\nmales during late pregnancy also alter their investment in progeny. These\nfemales give birth to offspring of a comparable weight to those produced by\nfemales exposed to the paternal male, but their offspring grow more slowly over\nlactation. As a consequence, offspring from these females weigh less at\nweaning. Modification of their growth trajectory, however, allows these\noffspring to catch up to normal weights by adulthood. Further, we also explore\nwhether the novel male presented in late pregnancy elicits a stress response in\nthe pregnant females and if there are further associated costs to the\noffspring’s behaviour or physiological and reproductive fitness.";"UNSW, Kensington, NSW, Australia"

The costs and benefits of this parental\ninvestment can vary between the sexes and are likely to shift over the breeding\ncycle. However, temporal and sex-specific changes in territory defence\nare currently poorly understood. To redress this gap, we experimentally\ninvestigated territory defence in a colour polymorphic biparental fish, the red\ndevil cichlid (Amphilophus labiatus).\nWe presented either gold or dark coloured conspecific models (i.e. dummies) to A. labiatus pairs at three key stages\nduring the breeding cycle (i.e. after pair formation, after eggs have been\nlaid, and when fry were free-swimming). We found that the sexes differed in\ntheir pattern of investment in territorial defence. Males were more aggressive\nwhen the pair first formed, whereas females significantly increased their\nterritory defence with time, and were most aggressive when fry were free swimming.\nHence, the results show that parental roles in territorial defence can markedly\nshift over key stages of the breeding cycle. We also found that although the\ncolour of the intruder did not influence the level of aggression by the\nparents, the colour of the parents themselves did have an effect, with the\ninvestment in territory defence being more male biased when the male was of the\ndark morph. Together our results suggest that the sexes in a pair invest in\nterritorial defence when it most profitable for them, but also importantly that\nthe relative share of aggression in regard to territorial defence is\ncolour-dependant.";"Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"

Studies in\nprimates have demonstrated that isolation and peer-rearing in infancy results\nin behavioural disturbances. In non primates however, the role played by the\nmother in the development of social interactions and social preferences is\nstill obscure. This was investigated in sheep by comparing groups of lambs\nreared from birth with or without their mother. General activity and nearest\nneighbour were recorded via scan sampling at various times. After nearest\nneighbours were identified, a reunion-separation test was performed in a novel\nenvironment in order to assess attachment behaviours. Mothered subjects were\nsequentially reunited with and separated from their mother and another maternal\newe while peer-reared lambs were reunited with and separated from their nearest\nand furthest neighbour. A preference test was then performed where lambs had to\nchoose between a group of 3 familiar and 3 non familiar congeners. Mothered\nlambs associated far closer with their mother than with any other ewe, and\nsometimes with specific juveniles. Even though some associations were observed\noccasionally in peer-reared lambs, they huddled mostly together in a single\ngroup when resting or displayed activities in a synchronised manner. In the\nreunion-separation test, while mothered lambs were strongly attracted to their\nmother during reunion, and distressed when separated (increased vocalisation\nand locomotion), they did not react to the other ewe. Peer-reared lambs by\ncontrast displayed no specific reaction to any neighbour. In the preference\ntest, mothered lambs spent significantly more time near the familiar than near\nthe unfamiliar group of congeners. Such discrimination was not expressed by\npeer-reared lambs. In conclusion, social preferences are clearly influenced by\nthe presence of the mother.

The more a female calls to the embryo, the higher the call similarity after hatching. Female vocal tutors increased incubation call rate to their embryos (and hence copy accuracy in chicks) when brood parasites called near the nest, but high call rate increased predation risk. These findings point to different costs and benefits of teaching effort by female vocal tutors. We predict that female vocal tutors should optimise (rather than maximise) their teaching effort to embryos. We test if female call syntax to embryos predicts the physiological response of embryos during learning tasks and copy accuracy after hatching. Embryos had lower heart rate (higher attention scores) when the call syntax of the female vocal tutor was four repeated elements followed by a novel element (e.g. AAAAB) rather than five repeated elements (e.g. AAAAA). These findings support the idea that female call syntax is under natural selection to enhance prenatal learning under conditions of high predation risk.";"Flinders University, Bedford Park, SA, Australia"

Sewage treatment works and fields\nfertilised with sewage sludge attract many foraging birds because of the\nabundance of invertebrate prey. Some pharmaceuticals, including the commonly\nprescribed antidepressant Fluoxetine (FLU), are persistent in the environment\nand can accumulate in invertebrates.

To assess the impacts\nof FLU-contaminated prey on wild birds, we fed wild-caught starlings Sturnus vulgaris an environmentally\nrelevant concentration of fluoxetine over 16 weeks. Assayed over two days in\nisolation, exploration in a novel environment, responses to human disturbance\nand activity levels were unaffected. Fluoxetine did affect the physiological\nresponses of FLU-treated birds in terms of their habituation to isolation\nstress compared with controls. In their home aviaries,\ncontrols increased their foraging rates at times of peak nutritional stress, as\nseen in other avian species during winter. The FLU-group, in contrast, did not\nvary their feeding rate over the day, thus their foraging behaviour showed them\nto be less sensitive to the risks of starvation and predation. Finally, we\nfound evidence that FLU altered courtship and social behaviours compared those\nof controls. Our data suggest that exposure to fluoxetine disrupts the\nrelationships between corticosterone, feeding behaviour and body mass\nregulation in birds, thus altering risk sensitivity. Fluoxetine is one of many psychoactive\ndrugs found in sewage which have the potential to alter the behaviour of\nwildlife. However, behavioural endpoints are currently not accepted in risk\nassessment of pharmaceuticals.

"Claudia Mettke-Hofmann";"Cognitive challenges to migratory birds in a modern world     (#476)";"Migration evolved as an adaptation to highly predictable environmental variation (seasonality). In contrast, human induced changes are often unpredictable and may challenge migrants more than other life-styles. Indeed, migrants are among the strongest declining species worldwide. Migrants have evolved adaptations in morphology, physiology but also cognition. Here I will review examples of cognitive abilities in migrants and how they may be of advantage or disadvantage in a rapidly changing world. As an adaptation to their seasonal environment migrants have evolved a long-term memory to find their way back to the breeding territory, the winter quarter and to remember high-quality stopover sites. This coincides with a relatively larger hippocampal formation while the rest of the forebrain is smaller than in residents. As migrants spent only limited periods of time in each habitat they explore changes in their familiar environment less and also explore novel environments more superficially than closely related resident species. Moreover, migrants show strong avoidance reactions to changes around their feeding location. With respect to personality traits, fewer individuals of a migratory species showed a bold personality type as compared to a closely related resident species. Taken together, the lower and more superficial exploration, particularly once they have settled down may make migrants more susceptible to unpredictable change. Moreover, the long-term memory for particular sites may be disadvantageous when habitats change. Finally, the strong avoidance of changes in their environment may push them into remaining unchanged habitat that is declining or exclude them from new resources. The combination of low exploration, reliance on memory rather than exploration and strong avoidance reactions to changes makes this group particularly vulnerable to unpredictable environmental change due to their lower flexibility in behaviour and lower propensity of bold individuals.";"Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom"

In the context of ecological invasions, it is thought that species with a large array of different personalities within their populations have the greatest chance of becoming ecological invaders when introduced to novel environments. The diversity of personalities within invasive species’ populations is not only central to understanding their invasion success, however. It is also central to predicting the long-term effects of invasive species management.The common (Indian) myna (Acridotheres tristis) is a highly successful worldwide invader that shows repeatable individual differences in neophobia, exploration and behavioural flexibility. Invasive to Australia, the species is the target of increasing control efforts. Evidence is accumulating that in areas with high levels of management, however, trapping success has decreased beyond what might be expected by a simple reduction in bird numbers, suggesting that some populations are showing compensatory responses to this anthropic predation pressure.In this study we explored whether selective removal of individuals with more ‘trap-friendly’ personalities, including a high propensity for exploration and boldness, might explain why populations are becoming more difficult to trap. We captured 50 common mynas using one of two methods: 1. a widely-used walk-in baited trap which required the birds to explore a large cage-like structure and enter it through small channels; 2. a discreet spring-loaded net which was placed in proximity of a large feeding patch. Netted and trapped birds were tested under captive conditions on a range of personality tests to identify differences in exploration, boldness, fearfulness, social behaviour, anti-predator responses and innovation.

If urban habitats select for problem-solving skills, we expect better performance to have greater positive effect on fitness in cities than in natural habitats. We tested this idea in great tits (Parus major) at two urban sites and two rural forests by measuring problem-solving performance as latency to solve an obstacle-removal task in which the nest-box entrance was blocked. In 82% of successful pairs, the solver was the female; urban birds were more likely to solve than rural birds. Faster-solving females laid more eggs and had higher hatching success (but not nestling survival), resulting in larger brood size at fledging. These relationships were similar in both habitats, and remained qualitatively unchanged when we statistically controlled for females’ motivation (nestling-feeding activity before the task), age, trapping experience, laying date, timing of the task (time of day; age of nestlings), neophobia (latency to enter the nest box in presence of a novel object), and risk taking in the contexts of predation risk and human disturbance (latency to enter the nest box after exposure to a sparrowhawk dummy and a human, respectively). Urban females were bolder in the sparrowhawk test than rural females; they showed no difference in the neophobia and human-disturbance tests. The higher reproductive success of faster-solving females may be due to better foraging abilities allowing them to invest more into egg formation and incubation. However, this effect was similar in both habitats, implying that problem-solving skills may be similarly beneficial in cities and natural habitats. The better performance of urban birds might then be explained by lower costs of problem solving, potentially including reduced predation risk as suggested by their higher risk taking.";"Department of Limnology, University of Pannonia, Veszprém, Hungary"
"Bruno A Buzatto";"The coevolution of weapons and testes: increased male density promotes sperm competition and reduces selection on arm strength in a chorusing frog     (#484)";"Male weapons are primarily involved in the early stages of mate competition (establishing territories and/or monopolising breeding resources), and are therefore mostly under precopulatory sexual selection. Male density can affect the relative strength of precopulatory and postcopulatory sexual selection (through sperm competition, for instance), which is central for the benefits males gain from investing in weaponry. Here, we explore how male density affects the strength of precopulatory sexual selection acting on male weaponry and the level of sperm competition experienced by males in natural populations of the Australian quacking frog (Crinia georgiana ), a species in which sperm competition results from multiple-male amplexus. We measured body size and arm girth of 444 males, and recorded their mating success in the field across a gradient of male densities. We found  a positive impact of relatively thicker arms on mating success at low densities, whereas increased density was associated with an increase in the probability of multi-male amplexus, and reduced selection on arm strength. This means thatas male density increases, selection favouring male investment in pre-mating contests is relaxed and postcopulatory sperm competition becomes the stronger selective pressure. Our study provides the first formal analysis of precopulatory sexual selection acting on arm strength in an anuran amphibian. In so doing we gain insight into the relationship between the number of males competing for females and the competitive advantage associated with male expenditure on weaponry.";"Centre for Evolutionary Biology, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia"

In particular, exaggerated jaws, horns and teeth may evolve\nthrough selection for males who can physically defend females (armaments) or\nthey may develop as badges of status, warning rivals off and advertising the\nmale’s quality to the female (ornaments). New Zealand sheet-web spiders (Cambridgea foliata) are one such species in which male chelicerae (jaws) are\nsubstantially larger than those of female conspecifics. We used an integrative\napproach, combining behavioural and morphological analyses to pinpoint the\nselective pressures acting on male chelicera and to examine how chelicera\nmorphology varies among males. We randomly paired males on female webs and\nrecorded their behaviours. Then, we compared both internal and external\nchelicera morphology of males and females of varying sizes to see how traits\nwere distributed and to study the relationship between external measures and\ninternal, biomechanical characteristics.

Intense sexual competition appears to have favoured the evolution of alternative male mating strategies in this species as males have a trimorphic phenotype in which weapon size varies across morphotype: 8th instar males have the smallest jaws, 10th instar males have the largest and 9th instar males being intermediate to the other two. After injecting males with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS; immune challenge) or saline (control), I measured their bite force to assess the functional performance of their jaws.

In mammals and\nbirds,\nthe most widespread mechanism for\nproducing honest acoustic cues to body size is via formant frequencies2,3 (vocal tract resonances). Bellows of crocodilians have\nlong been thought to advertise a caller’s size4, especially because relative size differences reliably predict the outcome\nof potentially lethal agonistic interactions5. Interestingly, to date, no empirical study has investigated whether bellows contain honest cues, further, the presence of formants has not been\ndemonstrated in any non-avian reptile. We tested for the existence of formants\nin crocodilians by inducing a Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) to bellow in an airtight chamber, using\nplaybacks. During vocalisations the animal was inhaling either normal air or heliox\n(helium/oxygen mixture). In heliox the speed of sound is increased causing an\nalteration of formant distribution in the sound spectrum. An acoustic analysis\nshowed a consistent shift of high-energy frequency bands in the spectrograms of\nvocalizations produced in heliox6. This strongly indicates the presence of formants. We subsequently recorded\nand analysed the bellows of 43 American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) and found a strong negative correlation\nbetween formant frequencies and body size, measured in total and head length7. Moreover, we found that the formant distribution\ndiffered between vocalisations produced on land and in water, but that in\neither case formants in bellows served as honest cues. As extant crocodilians share an almost interchangeable\ncall repertoire8, we propose that the bellows of all species contain\nreliable assessment cues to a potential rival’s body size.";"University of Vienna, Vienna, VIENNA, Austria"

The first of these two problems, finding the\noptimal path between multiple locations, is not an easy task to solve. Known as\nthe travelling salesman problem, with each point added to the path the\nnumber of potential routes that can be taken increases exponentially. Despite\nthis, in both lab and field studies bumblebees have been demonstrated to\nconverge upon optimal repeatable circuits (traplines) between forage sources\nusing a set of simple learning heuristics (Lithorieu et al 2012). Using\nharmonic radar, my colleagues and I tracked the first 50 foraging bouts of\nbumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers\npresented with 5 artificial nectar filled ‘flowers’ arranged in\na trapezoidal array. The ‘flowers’ in the array are spaced so that bees\nfollowing the behaviourally simplest nearest-neighbour rule would not be able\nto find the optimal route. Our study is the first to continuously track every\nconsecutive foraging bout of a bumblebee as it discovers each of the five\npresented ‘flowers’ and develops a trapline through an array of resources. We\nfound that foragers converge on more similar and efficient traplines over time,\nbut never reached the optimal foraging route, or the shortest route available\nfollowing the shortest neighbour rule. Preliminary analysis of forager tracks\nhas found that bees deviated from the shortest path between known forage\nsources at semi-regular intervals. These deviations in flight behaviour appear\nto take forager bees over areas where artificial ‘flowers’ would be\nexpected to be located based on her experience of the positions of the other 5 forage\nsources. We therefore suggest these deviations represent directed exploration\nflights based on foragers predicting the position of potential feeding\nlocations based on the spatial pattern of the artificial 'flowers' provided.";"Rothamsted Research, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, United Kindom"

The UV reflectance peak of B. anynana brown scales shifted to violet over six generations of artificial selection (i.e., in less than 1 year) as the result of an increase in the thickness of the lower lamina in ground scales.

Recently, many important methodological  innovations and developments have been done, yet the area is still suffering from a  lack of an integrated approach i.e combining the information of physiology and behavioural response of animals (rev. Kemp et al. 2015). Although many useful indirect methods e.g. tools for modelling the perception, have been developed, selection still acts through the behavioural responses alone. The ability of an organism to distinguish between different colours is irrelevant unless it actually uses that information to guide its responses. Another important point is that although our understanding of how animals perceive the world has improved over recent decades, we must next understand how this perception can vary, not just between species, but also within them. If there is indeed individual variation within species, our estimates of their visual capabilities may be misleading. Ultimately, individual variation is the raw material for natural selection, and thus a key ingredient to our understanding of perception as an adaptation.

A\nfundamental but not fully resolved question is how individuals recognize other\nspecies’ calls. Although individuals respond to heterospecific calls that are\nacoustically similar to their own, alarm calls vary greatly among species and eavesdropping probably also\nrequires learning. Surprisingly, however, there have been no fully controlled\nstudies showing the importance of learning when eavesdropping on alarm calls.\nWe show experimentally that individual wild superb fairy-wrens, Malurus cyaneus, can learn to recognize unfamiliar\nalarm calls. Individuals were trained by broadcasting novel sounds while\nsimultaneously presenting a gliding predatory bird. Fairy-wrens originally\nignored these sounds, but most fled to the sounds after two days’ training. The\nlearned response was not due to increased responsiveness in general, because\nbirds did not flee to novel sounds to which they were not trained. The response\nwas also not due to sensitization following repeated exposure, and was\nindependent of novel call structure. Learning can therefore help explain\neavesdropping, despite variation in alarm calls among species, and so can tailor\nbehaviour to the local community of predators and prey. In combination with\nprevious work showing that alarm signals can facilitate novel predator\nrecognition, our results imply rapid spread of anti-predator behaviour within\nwild populations.";"Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"

Evidence of the same neural circuitry across mammalian and bird species, and alignment of critical periods of vocal behaviour, has been used to support the evolutionary theory that the infant cry pathway has remained unchanged or converged toward a similar configuration to ensure reproductive success within a range of environments and social situations (Lingle et al, 2012). In support of this premise, distress vocalisation features including latency, vocalisation rate, fundamental frequency and other acoustic parameters are now commonly recognised to reflect neurobehavioral integrity in both the human and rodent neonate. Using a translational approach, the aims of this study were to investigate the acoustic parameters of neonate lamb distress vocalisations associated with cognitive functioning and maternal-infant behaviour. Following an initial study where delayed vocalisation was found to be associated with poor vigour-related behaviours in the first 12 hours post partum (Morton et al, 2014), further studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship of acoustic signal characteristics with markers indicative of fetal distress, and the impact of deficient signals on maternal response. The results of these studies indicate that lambs with delayed vocal responses emit fewer, and often inappropriate signals, with acoustic parameters reflecting low vocal intensity and stability, which were less likely to be preferred by ewes in a 2 choice test (p<0.05). Delayed vocalisation latency was also associated with elevated plasma glucose (r=0.45, p<0.005), longer parturition (r=0.61, p<0.01) and heavier birth weight (r=0.33, p<0.05). The results support the hypothesis that delayed vocalisation responsiveness in neonate lambs is associated with fetal distress; poor signal efficiency; and suboptimal maternal arousal. Compromised vocal cues, and in particular distress vocalisation latency, may be used as an indicator of deficient neurobehavioural status in the neonate.

We experimentally increased the perceived\nrisk of nest predation prior to egg-laying in eight bird species that comprise\na range of life-history and ecological characteristics, allowing us to test\nwhich factors play a role in the expression of risk-dependent reproductive\nflexibility. The perceived increase in the risk of nest predation had little\neffect on clutch size, egg size and clutch volume across species. However,\nspecies with an extended association between parents and offspring\nsubstantially increased their within-clutch variation in egg volume. These\nfindings indicate that risk-induced changes in reproductive allocation differ among\nspecies. Furthermore, within-clutch variation in egg size is a previously\nunconsidered response to an increase in nest predation risk. Birds decrease\ntheir provisioning rate with an increased risk of nest predation, but predation\nrisk may change rapidly within a breeding event. Thus, species may adopt a\nbrood reduction strategy over uniformly altering their reproductive investment\nwhen the risk is high at the time of laying.

"Nolwenn Fresneau";"It takes two to tango: consequences of artificial selection on offspring begging for parent-offspring communication     (#521)";"Solicitation\nfor food (so-called begging) by as yet dependent nestlings of altricial bird\nspecies is thought to signal offspring need towards the parents. Begging is\ncostly to perform but crucial for the nestling via its positive effects on\ngrowth and survival. However, offspring begging is subject to a complex\nevolutionary trajectory, because it is not only affected by the offspring’s\nstate, but also by the way how parents alter their provisioning in response to\nit. Begging is therefore not only dependent on the genotype of the offspring (direct\ngenetic effect) but also on its parents’ genotype (indirect genetic effect). Parental\nprovisioning and offspring begging are consequently likely to coevolve, which may\nultimately lead to a coadaptation between these traits. Such coadaptation has been\nshown at the phenotypic level, it is now important to understand if it results from\na genetic correlation. One powerful tool to study this question is to impose\nartificial selection on either of the behavioural traits involved, and to study\nthe consequences on parent-offspring communication. Using\ncanaries (Serinus canaria) as a model\nspecies we applied a bidirectional artificial selection on low and high begging\nbehaviour for three consecutive generations.

We found a positive response to artificial selection in the\nhigh begging line, while our selection appeared to be less successful in the\nlow begging line. The latter may be due to the fact that begging presents a\nfitness-relevant trait, which is more difficult to negatively select on. Nestlings\nsurvived indeed significantly less well in the low begging line compared to the\nhigh begging line. We are currently analysing whether the observed changes in\noffspring begging affected parent-offspring communication.

"Cesar Gonzalez-Lagos";"Avian urban dwellers are better invaders due to their enhanced behavioral plasticity     (#523)";"Behavioral plasticity has been identified as a major feature of successful invaders, but the underlying mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Because successful invaders tend to attain higher success in urbanized environments, we argue that a main mechanism by which behavioral plasticity should facilitate invasions is by allowing individuals to better exploit such human-altered habitats. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of historical avian introductions, we show that species that are more tolerant to urbanization in their region of origin are also more successful at establishing themselves following human-mediated introductions. However, this is not simply because urban tolerant species are more readily available for introductions or because urbanized environments are easier to invade; rather, successful avian invaders are characterized by a number of adaptations -notably a larger brain relative to body size, a broader habitat preferences, and a life history strategy based on prioritizing future reproduction- that allow them better adjusting their behavior to the drastic environmental alterations that characterize urbanized environments. Our results provide thus evidence for the commonly assumed but rarely demonstrated hypothesis that behavioral plasticity allows animals to cope with environmental disturbances, an issue of considerable conservation relevance in a context of rapid-human induced environmental changes. ";"Instituto de Ciencias Ambientales y Evolutivas, Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, Chile"

The first experiment was designed to test hypothesis that males use\nsoft song during territorial intrusions to avoid being predated [3]. We used\nmicrophone array allowing for amplitude measurements in the field and simulated\nterritorial intrusion into ortolan bunting territories by a stranger male\n(playback + model presented) in a paired design experiment (N=27 males tested\ntwice). In random order, we presented (treatment) or did not presented\n(control) a predator (Falco tinnuculus)\nand its calls before simulated intrusion of a non-neighbour male. We found that\nortolan bunting males responded to conspecific playback in a typical way by\napproaching and producing songs and calls. In 41% of experimental treatments\nand in 44% of controls the responding males produced also soft songs. However,\nwe found no significant relationship between presence of a predator and\nresponse of males to playback. In particular, we found no significant\ndifference in producing soft songs between treatment and control experiments. However,\nthe presence of other conspecific males in vicinity affected response. We found\nno support for the predator avoidance hypothesis.

The\nfiddler crab is one of these few exceptions. The male weapon is an enlarged\nclaw that is used in male-male fights over territories, and is also used in\ncourtship displays. The enlarged claw splits the populations in right and\nleft-handed males. Fights can be classified as between same- or different-handed\ncombatants. Fights escalate from pushing to the interlocking of claws (called\ngrappling). Here we investigate the effect of handedness in fight outcome by\ninducing and observing inter-male contests. We recorded fight escalation level,\nduration, size, winner and tested whether these variables differ between same-\nand different-handed fights. Different-handed fights are more likely to\nescalate to grappling, suggesting that it is harder for the combatants to judge\nthe opponents’ strength in this situation. We suggest that this is due to\ndistinct positioning of same- and different-handed opponents resulting in\ndistinct force mechanics. Since the likelihood of injury and energy expenditure\nare higher when opponents are different-handed, why are both fight types\nequally likely to happen? Finding a same-handed opponent may incur higher\nenergetic costs than those incurred by fighting a different-handed male. Further\ninvestigations of handedness in fight outcome may shed light on the selective\npressures causing and maintaining the handedness ratio in populations.";"Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"
"Tsuyoshi Takeuchi";"The erroneous courtship hypothesis: do insects really engage in aerial wars of attrition?     (#534)";"Males of\nvarious flying insects perform conspicuous aerial interactions around their\nmating stations. The broadly accepted interpretation of their aerial\ninteraction is a war of attrition, where two contestants perform costly\ndisplays, and the one that reaches its cost threshold earlier gives up. The\nparticular requirement in this model is that some forces to match the intensity\nof display of the two contestants are necessary, and failure to enforce\nmatching allows foul contestants that delay or stop their display to avoid\npaying contest costs. In addition, wars of attrition require flying insects to\ndistinguish the sex of flying conspecifics,\nbecause their aerial interactions begin when intruders fly into the territory.\nWe investigated past research on the behavior of territorial odonates and\nbutterflies to clarify whether the two prerequisites of wars of attrition are fulfilled:\n1) contestants can inflict substantial costs on non-displaying opponents, 2)\ncontestants can discriminate the sex of flying conspecifics. In territorial odonates,\nwe found an abundance of evidence that contests involve physical attack and\nthat the ability of sexual discrimination is sufficient. Therefore, wars of\nattrition may occur in odonates. In territorial butterflies, however, we could\nnot find any evidence that the two prerequisites are filled. Based on Lloyd\nMorgan’s Canon: the\nprinciple of parsimony in comparative psychology, males of\nterritorial butterflies cannot distinguish the sex of flying conspecifics, and their\naerial interactions are better interpreted as erroneous courtship between\nsexually active males. We constructed a model of male-male interactions of\nbutterflies assuming that they maximize their fitness under the constraint that\nthey cannot discriminate the sexes of flying conspecifics. We could interpret past\nresearch on butterfly contests by this erroneous courtship model. We think that the erroneous\ncourtship model is far simpler than the war of attrition model, and that it is\nadequate for butterflies.";"Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Japan"
"Max Ringler";"Acoustic ranging in Poison Frogs – Allobates femoralis uses signal cues beyond intensity to assess caller distance     (#535)";"Acoustic ranging – to properly asses the distance of a sound source, like a competing male – is especially important for animals that live in highly territorial systems. In this context, it is often used to maintain individual spacing in order to avoid costly physical conflicts between neighbouring individuals. At the same time accurate ranging allows territory holders to make reliable decisions when to engage other callers that might be competing for space and mates. To assess intensity independent ranging in frogs, we performed playbacks with the Neotropical poison frog Allobates femoralis. Males of this species are known for their stable, long-term territories, which they announce by prolonged advertisement calling. We simultaneously recorded advertisement calls across 0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 m in Neotropical rainforest, the natural habitat of the study species, to obtain naturally degraded and reverberated signals. These signals were normalised and broadcast at equal intensity from an equal distance to territorial males. Males showed significantly differential responses to signals recorded from different distances, with close, less degraded, and less reverberated recordings eliciting much stronger responses than far ones. The threshold for aggressive phonotaxis corresponded with previously measured territory sizes in the study population. This clearly shows that also frogs can perceive and evaluate signal characteristics beyond intensity to assess the distance of a sound source and to maintain inter-individual distances.";"University of Vienna, Vienna, VIENNA, Austria"

Zebrafish were originally developed as a model system by Dr George Streisinger\nto study the genetic basis of behavior in vertebrates. This species was chosen\nbecause it is easy to maintain in captivity, reproduces weekly with large clutches,\nthe embryos are optically clear allowing for the visualization of development,\nthey develop rapidly, and the genome is sequenced. These characteristics have\nnow allowed us to visualize neuronal activity in an intact behaving animal by\nexpressing genetically encoded calcium indicators in selected neurons.My lab studies how the environment affects the\ndevelopment of the olfactory sensory system and the resulting olfactory driven\nbehaviors (Stephenson et al., 2011, 2012). We have used the zebrafish as a\nmodel system to dissect mechanisms of olfactory imprinting originally described\nin Pacific Salmon. We have shown that zebrafish make and maintain long-term\nolfactory memories or olfactory imprinting and this\nolfactory imprinting is correlated with changes in gene expression in the\nolfactory sensory neurons (Harden et\nal., 2006; Whitlock, 2006), including changes in olfactory receptor expression\nthat are PEA-isoform specific (Calfun et al., unpublished). Thus an animal’s olfactory behavior is\nbiased toward early life experiences. Experience dependent learning of odors is important in\n“real” fish: through a study of the impact of salmon on native Chilean species we\nhave shown that the puye (Galaxias maculatus) must learn to avoid the odors of\nBrown Trout (Salmo trutta fario) and\nAtlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) (both\ninvasive species). Studies using zebrafish have led to\nthe discovery of a genome-wide duplication event in teleosts, evidence for extreme\nlateralization of visual behaviors and their underlying circuits, and the\neffects of lab rearing on the sex determination mechanisms in this species.

"John Ewer";"Genetic dissection of neuropeptide-controlled behavior     (#537)";"The insect molt culminates with ecdysis, a vital behavior that is used to shed the remains of the old cuticle. Ecdysis includes several behavioral subroutines and physiological events that are expressed sequentially to loosen and then shed the old cuticle, then expand and harden the new one. Work on a variety of insects has shown that ecdysis is triggered by the neuropeptide, Ecdysis-Triggering Hormone (ETH), which activates sequentially a number of peptidergic neurons, all of which express the ETH receptor (ETHR), and include neurons that produce Eclosion Hormone, Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP), and bursicon, amongst others.To understand how the complex ecdysial sequence is controlled we have used Drosophila to investigate the consequences on ecdysis behavior of disabling specific neurohormones and their receptors. We have also examined the responses of the corresponding peptidergic neurons and of motoneurons to ETH challenges in vitro, by using a calcium sensitive GFP to monitor the resulting patterns of neural activation.Our results reveal that the actions of neurohormones downstream of ETH together with GABA-mediated inhibitory actions configure the network’s response to ETH. The resulting patterns of neural activity then control the ensuing sequence of behavioral subroutines.Our findings contribute to the further understanding of how ecdysis behavior is controlled, and provide insights for understanding how neuropeptides can fundamentally alter the output of a neural network. We will also discuss these findings in light of the fact that ecdysial neurohormones and their receptors are extremely conserved, yet can play different roles in the control of ecdysis between different developmental stages and in different insects.";"Universidad de Valparaiso, Valparaiso, VALPARAISO, Chile"

Unfortunately, this ‘impact’ is measured by various proxies that ostensibly reflect the importance of academics’ contributions to the scientific literature, but which are fundamentally flawed. Here, I will synthesise research that shows that, as long as selection in academia rewards impact rather than integrity, academic selection has and will continue to result in: bias in the academic literature; irreproducibility of results and over-inflation of effect sizes; weakening of the public trust in science; the attrition of women in academia; and, in extreme cases, public and/or personal harm. From this evidence, I will ask whether, as an early-career researcher, there is any incentive to develop new systems or whether the ‘safer bet’ results in the continued use of existing models and the potential loss of creativity in approaching research questions.";"-"

Sexual selection explains sex differences in ornamentation and in various other phenotypes, but does not easily explain cases where those phenotypes are similar in males and females. Understanding such similarities requires knowing how phenotypes influence nonsexual social interactions as well, which can be very important in gregarious animals, but whose role for phenotypic evolution has been overlooked. For example, ‘mate choice’ experiments often found preferences for ornamentation, but have not assessed whether those are strictly sexual or are general social preferences. Using choice experiments with a gregarious and mutually ornamented finch, the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild), we show that preferences for ornamentation in the opposite-sex also extend to same-sex interactions. Waxbills discriminated between opposite- and same-sex individuals, but most preferences for colour traits were similar when interacting with either sex. Similar preferences in sexual and nonsexual associations may be widespread in nature, either as social adaptations or as by-product of mate preferences. In either case, such preferences may set the stage for the evolution of mutual ornamentation and of various other similarities between the sexes.";"CIBIO - Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources, University of Porto, Vairão, Portugal"

For instance, most individual behavioural traits, such as aggression, courtship, or vigilance, are a direct consequence of the social environment or social competition. These traits however, are often studied in isolation and as a result, relatively few studies have examined the role that social context plays in developing and modifying individual behavioural differences. Here we examine this question from two different perspectives; the effect of social context on individuals, and the effects of individuals on group-level behaviour. We find social context has a significant effect on the behaviour of juvenile damselfish and that this effect is lessened in adults, suggesting younger individuals are more likely to conform to their respective social groups. Additionally, we find group behaviour varies as a result of both the age and personality of group members, thus suggesting both conformity and individuality interact to determine group behaviour and decision-making. By discussing these results in the context of both collective behaviour/decision-making and current animal personality research, this study sheds new light on how and when individuals may adjust their behaviour in groups.";"School of Biological Sciences, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW"

However, strong social ties can\nalso reduce reproductive success in certain contexts, such as in high-density\nenvironments. The consequences of individuals’ patterns of sociability in\ngregarious species that form preferential associations in the absence of\ncooperative behaviours, as is the case for female eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), are less well known\nthan for species with cooperative behaviours. We have analysed nearly five\nyears of reproductive and social data from over 120 individually-recognized\nwild eastern grey kangaroos to test whether measures of individual females’\nsociability were related to their reproductive success. We used generalised\nlinear mixed models to explore how sociability indices and lagged rainfall (a\nproxy for grass abundance) influenced the reproductive outputs and offspring\nsurvival of females. Females with larger social networks and those who formed\npreferential associations with a higher number of other individuals had fewer\nyoung that survived to weaning than did less sociable females. Offspring\nsurvival to weaning was also higher for females who maintained larger distances\nto their nearest neighbour during foraging. In contrast to these results, there\nwere no effects of mothers’ sociability on the survival of their young to the\nlarge pouch-young stage. Thus female kangaroos’ sociability affected the\nsurvival of their young only once the young had begun leaving the pouch,\nsuggesting that this negative effect may have resulted from an increased risk\nto the young of losing their mothers in higher density situations.  Our findings thus suggest that the benefits\nof sociability in mammals may be affected by density-dependent processes. The\nmaintenance of individual differences in sociability may involve further\nlife-history trade-offs or variation in environmental conditions.";"University of Queensland, Brisbane, ACT, Australia"

Different species possess distinct areas\nof high photoreceptors and ganglion cell density that reflect different interactions\nwith congeners, prey and likely different predatory strategies.

Variation\nin spectral sensitivity has been documented within the retinas of a diverse and\ngrowing number of vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. In such species, the\nappearance of objects and signals will depend on the sensitivity of the retinal\nregion that detects them. The retina's spectral sensitivity is determined primarily\nby visual pigments of the photoreceptors. These visual pigments are comprised\nof an opsin protein bound to a chromophore, and altering either molecule can\nmodify the pigment's absorbance spectrum. We use dual-labeling fluorescent in situ hybridisation to determine the\ndistribution of opsins within cell types and across the retinas of African\ncichlids. The cichlids of Africa's Great Lakes are noteworthy because they form\nnew species extremely rapidly, due in part to coevolution of spectral\nsensitivity and male nuptial colouration. We found that in the cichlid Metriaclima zebra, double cones (pairs\nof partially fused cone cells) mix different combinations of opsins in retinal\nregions that view distinct backgrounds. This opsin coexpression increases\nabsorbance of the corresponding backgrounds, and modeling indicates this could facilitate\ndetection of dark objects. Thus, opsin coexpression may be a novel mechanism of\nspectral tuning that could be useful for detecting prey, predators and mates.\nHowever, our calculations show that coexpression of some opsins can hinder\ncolour discrimination, creating a trade-off between visual functions.

In a decade long study across south eastern Australia we measured phenotypic traits among multiple populations, particularly focusing on breeding pairs in two intermediate, clinally varying populations, in order to evaluate the contribution of assortative mating to population divergence. Highly variable yellow-red plumage coloration, produced by psittacofulvin pigments unique to parrots, has hitherto been the only trait used to define populations, but we found no assortative mating for such pigmentary colours.  We did find that pigmentation was strongly associated with climate, and was discordant with microsatellite variation, indicating a role for selection in maintaining diversity. By contrast, the ultraviolet-blue coloration based on feather nanostructure, was sexually dimorphic and showed assortative mating. Our findings suggest that structural coloration provides more important sexual signals than pigmentary coloration in this parrot, and perhaps in parrots in general.  Our work also suggests how the lack of condition dependence in parrots’ pigmentary coloration may have contributed to the ‘popularity’ of parrots as pets, and thereby the high proportion of threatened species worldwide.  The possible role of other factors such as disease (beak and feather disease virus), and subspecies differences in spectral tuning, in maintaining variability in this species complex is also discussed.

The\nincubating mate’s optimal wait time before abandoning the nest themselves given\nan initial estimate from the population of the likelihood their partner is of\nthe type to return, p, is found by maximising the incubating mates payoff\nfunction. It is shown that as p increases, the optimal waiting time is longer. Differentiating\nthe optimal payoff function with respect to p allows us to quantify the value\nof information. Gaining knowledge allows refinement of the initial estimate of\np altering the incubating mates waiting time, thereby increasing the expected payoff.\nMonogamy is the prevailing mating system in birds and much is to be understood\nof the functions and mechanisms behind these long term affiliations. The value\nof knowing your partner may explain why some species form long term\nrelationships.";"University of Bristol, Clifton, BRISTO, United Kingdom"

To avoid unnecessary injury during these conflicts, opponents\nmay engage in signalling behaviours to convey information about their fighting ability\nor motivational state. In some cases, more than one signal modality is used to\neither increase information transfer or allow for signal redundancy. Crustaceans\nengage in competitive behaviour and it is likely that they use multimodal\nsignals in these contests. In particular, stomatopods fight aggressively over refuges\nand are known to use chemical and postural displays. However, we know little\nabout chromatic communication and the interaction with chemical communication\nin stomatopod agonistic encounters. Here, we investigate the signalling role of\nmeral spot UV reflectance (a patch displayed during the postural display known\nas the meral spread) and if there is redundancy with chemical communication. Neogonodactylus oerstedii were collected\nat the Smithsonian Research Station in Belize and allocated to size matched,\nsame sex pairs. UV reflectance of the resident’s (with refuge) meral spots was\nremoved using a paint mix and the ability of intruders (without refuge) to\ndetect chemical cues was removed by dipping antennae in fresh water. Thus, we\nmodified the presence of UV reflectance and chemical cues available to\nintruders during agonistic encounters. When UV reflectance was absent we\ndetected a strong trend towards shorter fights (p = 0.067) with a higher rate of offensive behaviours (p = 0.063). In the absence of chemical\ncues, the speed of approach towards the burrow was faster (p = 0.029). We propose that stomatopods may be using UV reflectance\nand chemical cues sequentially (rather than simultaneously) to assess an\nopponent’s fighting ability and/or the presence of an opponent in a burrow.\nFrom here, we can further assess the information encoded in these signals to expand\nour knowledge of crustacean communication systems. ";"Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States"

Meerkats, Suricata suricatta, a member of the\nmongoose family, forage as a cohesive group with each of them searching for\ntheir own prey in the sand. They typically keep a distance of 0.5 to 20 m to\ntheir neighbor, and frequently emit close calls while foraging. These calls\nappear important in maintaining contact to the other group members. Through\nsubtle changes in the acoustic structure of close calls, before they turn into\naggressive growls or snarls with physical competition, they ensure a spacing\ndistance among group members. These subtle acoustic changes are reflected by a\nmore noisy call structure, and are typically associated with an aggressive\nemotional state of the caller. In addition, close calls convey information on\nthe identity of the producer. I present data on how much of the social\ninformation is used by receivers and its effects on the spatial organization\nand the coordination of group movement. This communication system provides a\nsimple, efficient mechanism to avoid aggression within competing foragers\nforced to stick together at a close distance, and plays a crucial\nmulti-functional role in the group dynamics while foraging.";"University of Zurich, Zürich, SWITZERLAND, Switzerland"

(#569)";"Parental age and many other aspects of parental life-histories can greatly affect many aspects of offspring fitness through non-genetic inheritance of organismal and postmeiotic gametic senescence. Although many studies have documented the parental effect of age on offspring lifespan, few have examined the detectability of such an effect and its interaction with grand-parental condition to as far as the third generation. We carried out a large-scale demographic study to examine the effects of grandparental age, social environment, and condition on the lifespan of the third generation of the neriid fly Teleostylinus angusticollis. Quality of diet at the developmental stage of this species has been shown to affect both the magnitude and expression of condition-dependent traits such as size and shape, whereby rich and poor larval diets generally result in large and small adult morphs, respectively. This variation in individual condition is also sex-specific, particularly in respect to the exaggeration of secondary sexual traits in males which are used in intraspecific competition for access to females. To examine the effects of grandparental condition on offspring lifespan, the first generation was reared on either a ‘rich’ or ‘poor’ diet and subjected to either high or low competitive environments. Grandparental and parental age at time of reproduction was also manipulated to either ‘young’ (15 days) or ‘old’ (35 days). All offspring were separated into matri- and patrilines to control for sex-specific differences in lifespan. Preliminary results suggest that grandparental age at the time of reproduction can significantly affect the lifespan of grandoffspring, whereas, condition and social environment appear to have no detectable influence. These results suggest that both paternal and maternal age effects on progeny lifespan may persist through multiple generations having important implications for the evolutionary dynamics of life-history strategies and the evolution of ageing.";"Evolution & Ecology Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"

The underlying phenotypic\nplasticity is assumed to be under selection. The adaptive value of such developmental\nplasticity is surprisingly little understood. A key problem hampering our\nunderstanding of the significance of developmental plasticity in animals is\nthat experiments usually target only a single environmental variable and/or a\nsingle ontogenetic period. However, in nature the development of\nwell-integrated phenotypes occurs under the influence of multiple environmental\nfactors and during a succession of ontogenetic stages. Lake Tanganyika cichlids\nprovide unique models to study the\ndevelopment of integrated phenotypes due to their behavioural and social complexity,\nand their amenability to experimental manipulation. In these species, experiments\nin semi-natural conditions can be combined with detailed ecological knowledge to\nunderstand the functional significance and the underlying mechanisms of\ndevelopmental plasticity. Here we present experimental results from maternal\nmouthbrooders (Simochromis pleurospilus)\nand cooperatively breeding cichlids (Neolamprologus\npulcher) showing that (i) maternal effects seem to target only those\nphases of offspring life when they actually promote survival, but are abolished\nafter this 'profitable period'1, (ii) maternal\neffects on behaviour and brain architecture can be fully reversed by direct\nearly experience of offspring2, and (iii)\nearly experience of multiple ecological factors can result in interacting\nreaction norms; the latter result suggests that organisms require information\non multiple environmental factors in order to express adequate plastic\nresponses.

Spiders that lose larger larders (i.e., spiders that lose larders consisting of more prey items) search for longer intervals, indicating that the spiders form memories of the size of the prey larders they have accumulated, and use those memories to regulate recovery efforts when the larders are pilfered. Here, we ask whether the spiders represent prey counts (i.e., numerosity) or a continuous integration of prey quantity (mass) in their memories. We manipulated larder sizes in treatments that varied in either prey size or prey numbers but were equivalent in total prey quantity (mass). We then removed the larders to elicit searching and used the spiders’ searching behavior as an assay of their representations in memory. Searching increased with prey quantity (larder size) and did so more steeply with higher prey counts than with single prey of larger sizes. Thus, Nephila spiders seem to track prey quantity in two ways, but to attend more to prey numerosity.

"Alex Taylor";"The signature testing approach to the evolution of intelligence     (#552)";"The evolution of intelligence is one of nature’s greatest mysteries. We have little idea how we came to be so clever, or even how our minds actually differ from those of other species. For over 100 years researchers have compared human and animal intelligence in order to gain insight into this area. However, these comparisons have been based on a “success-testing” approach, where researchers simply examine whether an animal can solve a problem or not. This approach has generated a great deal of debate, but little progress, because success-testing is flawed. Just because an animal solves a problem, it does not follow that the animal has used the same cognitive mechanisms as humans to do so. Inspired by Alan Turing’s work on machine intelligence, I will argue we need to adopt a novel “signature-testing” approach to avoid this problem. By searching for the signatures of cognitive mechanisms (their limits, errors and biases) it is possible to demonstrate whether a human and an animal truly think in the same way or not. I will outline how signature-testing can chart the evolution of intelligence and demonstrate its potential for two areas of comparative cognition: causal reasoning and metacognition.";"University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"
"Stephan J Schoech";"Behavioral type and corticosterone responsiveness are linked in Florida scrub-jays: exploring causes and consequences of physio-behavioral phenotypes     (#494)";"Our long-term study of\nfree-living Florida scrub-jays (FSJ, Aphelocoma\ncoerulescens) has revealed a strong relationship between an individual’s\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response during capture-and-handling stress\nand behavioral type. The physiological response and behavioral type covary,\nleading to our coining the term\nphysio-behavioral phenotype. Low stress-induced corticosterone (SI-CORT)\nresponders are less neophobic, more exploratory, and better at associative, yet\nworse at reversal (i.e., less flexible), learning when compared to high SI-CORT FSJs.\nOngoing monitoring reveals that the SI-CORT responsiveness (and to a lesser\ndegree, baseline CORT levels) and behavioral type persist over much, if not the\nentirety, of an individual’s life. Some propose that behavioral flexibility be\nconsidered in selecting individuals for managed translocations (FSJs are a\nthreatened species), as boldness and adaptability would be essential in new environments. Similarly, flexibility also could allow individuals to differentially adapt to changing environments associated with global climate change. We\ncontinue to investigate causes and consequences associated with physio-behavioral\nphenotypes which are seemingly shaped early in life as is indicated by our\nfindings that: 1) better parenting (e.g., higher maternal nest attendance and\npaternal food delivery) leads to lower nestling CORT levels; 2) baseline CORT\nlevels of nestlings predict degree of\nboldness 8 mo later; 3) food supplemented nestlings had lower SI-CORT responses\nat nutritional independence (~70 d post-hatch), a characteristic that persisted\nthrough 2 years; 4) broods with a CORT-treated nestling beg more than control\nbroods and nestling begging rate predicts SI-CORT response at nutritional\nindependence and when 1-yr-old; and 5) SI-CORT responses at independence predict boldness 6-8 months later. Given\nthese findings, it’s clear that multiple developmental influences are in play. The\nphysio-behavioral phenotype is also associated with sex-specific differences in\nlifespan. Low SI-CORT, bold males live longer whereas the opposite is true for\nfemales. We speculate that the sex-specific division of labor during\nreproduction results in different energetic costs and predation risks for male\nand female FSJs with similar phenotypes.";"University of Memphis, Memphis, TN USA, TN, United States"

A total of 128 biopsy samples were obtained from\nfree-ranging individuals within several schools of common dolphins.

"Andrew Robins";"Lateralized visual processing in cattle herds - why is there a “near side” and “off side” for human-animal interactions?     (#496)";"When challenged individually or in small groups with novel visual stimuli, domestic horses and cattle have been found to possess a significant preference to use the left eye (right brain hemisphere) to first inspect and cognitively process the potential threat [1-4]. By contrast, familiar, non-threatening stimuli are preferentially viewed with the right eye. These forms of lateralized visual processing correspond with similar studies in other mammals, birds and reptiles, and reflect lateralized control of the autonomic flight/fight system in vertebrates. However, the findings present a paradox to traditional handling methods of haltered livestock, in which their left flank is referred to as the “near side”, and right flank as the “off side”. While common interpretation of the origin of these terms relates to the right-handedness of the human rider, bullock-train or coach driver, we present here new findings of visual preferences in cattle suggesting how livestock may tolerate a novel human on their immediate left, and not right, side. Results from a series of approach tests of 18 pens of cattle feeding in large groups of 90-120 head reveal that cattle are initially more likely to take flight when the human is unable to be viewed with the left eye. Approach of the human from the right visual field is less well tolerated in cattle without social companions on their left side: they cease feeding and depart the feed bunk. By contrast, acceptance of the approach of a novel human is more likely when viewed within the left, and not right visual field. This is especially true of cattle with social companions on their immediate right side.  We will discuss this new finding of lateralized social cooperation in cattle herds as a strategy to mitigate the stress of human-animal interaction, within the broader context of domestication. 1";"Centre for Animal Welfare and Ethics, University of Queensland, Gatton, QLD, Australia"

"Shaun P Collin";"The evolution and development of photoreception in an ancient vertebrate: Implications for visual behavior in lampreys     (#410)";"Meeting the challenges of visually sampling an ancient aquatic landscape by the early vertebrates was crucial to their survival and would establish a photoreceptive bauplan to be used by all subsequent vertebrate descendents. Image-forming eyes were under tremendous selection pressure and the ability to identify suitable prey and detect potential predators was thought to be one of the major drivers of speciation in the Early Cambrian. Using extant representatives of the earliest stage in vertebrate evolution (lampreys), we have investigated the evolution and development of photoreception (image formation and irradiance detection) at both the peripheral (visual and non-visual tissues of the body) and the central (optic tectum and pineal organ) nervous systems. Using anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular approaches to measure photoreceptive capacity, we explored the environmental drivers of visual behavior in these ancient vertebrates. Our results reveal that lampreys possess complex visual and non-visual photoreceptive systems, with well-developed eyes with the potential for at least tetrachromatic colour discrimination and photoreceptive cells in the pineal organ, that are able to provide chromatic input to set circadian levels of activity. We also reveal that the input to the optic tectum and pineal organ also varies over the adult lamprey lifecycle, where ecological factors such as light conditions and habitat exert a significant influence on brain structure size and consequently on behavioural activity patterns. This work offers a unique opportunity to understand how phylogenetic constraints and environmental signals influence the development of the visual pathway in an ancient vertebrate that has existed for over 500 million years.";"University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"

"Daniel Hoops";"The evolution of brain structure in dragon lizards     (#446)";"Many phenotypic traits such\nas behaviour, body shape, and colour are shaped by a combination of both natural and sexual selection.\nHowever, the two evolutionary processes often act in opposition. Natural\nselection usually acts to improve fitness by increasing survival. In contrast,\nsexual selection acts to improve fitness by increasing the likelihood of\nsuccessful mating. This often results in characters, such as conspicuous\nornaments and breeding colours, that seem to reduce survival. The interaction\nbetween these two modes of selection has been well studied for many traits, but\nthe relative effects of natural and sexual selection on brain evolution is\nstill relatively unknown. How does each type of selection influence brain\nstructure? And how do the relative roles of natural and sexual selection\ncompare to those on other traits closely associated with fitness such as\ncolouration, body size, and key life history traits? To test the interaction\nbetween natural and sexual selection, we used high-resolution\nmagnetic resonance imaging combined with traditional histology to document brain\nstructure in 14 lizard species belonging\nto the Australian genus Ctenophorus (known\nas dragons). These species exist in discrete ecological types or “ecotypes”,\nwhich are behaviourally distinct, and vary in the strength of sexual\nselection they experience, which also influences their behaviour.  At the\nlevel of major brain regions we found only evidence of natural selection acting\non brain structure. However, when examining specific brain nuclei that are\ndirectly involved with reproductive behaviours we also found evidence that sexual\nselection has shaped the structure of the brain.

Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were observed during adolescence in mixed-sex pairs, mixed-sex juvenile\ngroups, and mixed-sex mixed-age groups.

Hylobatids have an equally long juvenile period\nbetween weaning and first reproduction as do the other nonhuman apes, despite\ntheir smaller body size. Part of this slow maturation is explained by slow physical\ngrowth, but dispersal and first reproduction in the wild can occur up to 2 – 6\nyears after cessation of growth, during which offspring may remain in the natal\ngroup.

Developmental timing differs according to the\nsocial context, with some markers occurring later in the natal group than they\ndo outside the natal group. Older offspring in the natal group display\nprosocial behaviour including spending time in close proximity to parents, grooming,\nand playing with younger siblings, despite showing evidence of adolescent\nbehaviours (e.g. lower activity levels, spatial distancing from parents). Slower\ndevelopment and conflict-avoidance behaviour of older offspring in the natal\ngroup may reduce conflict in the family and facilitate delayed dispersal. In\naddition, participation in social play with younger siblings increases the\ninclusive fitness of delayed dispersers.

"Melissa Bateson";"A memory of hunger: effects of early-life adversity on adult foraging behaviour in European starlings.     (#590)";"Behavioural ecology has provided many examples of how the behaviour of animals can respond adaptively to changes in their current state. In most of these cases, the states studied are reversible, short-term states such as level of fat reserves. However, it is also possible for an animal’s state to be permanently altered by the conditions that it experiences early in its development. In my talk I will explore the hypothesis that animals could develop adaptive behavioural responses to the state that they have been dealt by their early developmental experience. We call this type of adaptive developmental plasticity (ADP) somatic-state based ADP to distinguish it from the more commonly discussed informational ADP, in which animals develop a phenotype that adapts them to a future environment predicted by a cue received during development. For the past three years, we have been using the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) as a model in which to explore how early-life adversity alters both state and adult food-related cognition and behaviour. We have developed short, post-hatching experimental manipulations of both food restriction and/or psychosocial stress, inspired by the consequences of natural variation in brood size in starlings. As a measure of how these manipulations affect state we have been using erythrocyte telomere length (ETL). ETL is a measure of cellular aging, that we argue provides an integrative biomarker of the cumulative stress experienced by a developing bird, and also prospectively predicts its future morbidity and mortality. Using a range of different foraging tasks we have shown that birds with poorer state, as indexed by shorter ETL, also show a suite of changes in foraging behaviour, including being faster to approach known food sources, faster to investigate unknown food sources and more impulsive when given a choice between a small immediate reward and a larger, but more delayed reward. Together these differences are suggestive of a “psychology of hunger” similar to that seen in acutely hungry animals. I suggest that this adult psychological phenotype could be an adaptive, plastic response to the impaired state of the birds, and hence a case of somatic state-based ADP. I end by discussing how we can test whether a particular case of developmental plasticity is adaptive and how we could distinguish somatic-state based plasticity from informational plasticity.";"Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom"
