tallison@awwi.org,Assessing Possible Actions to Mitigate Take of Golden Eagles at Wind Energy Facilities , American Wind Wildlife Institute  Washington,Taber,"Wind energy has expanded rapidly in the past decade becominga significant source of electricity, and a major element in aglobal strategy to reduce carbon emissions and the effects of climate change. Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) can collidewith turbines, adding to the substantial mortality from other anthropogenic sources. These collisions pose a legal risk to wind energy companies and potentially hamper development in areas where the range of Golden Eagles overlaps areas of high wind energy potential. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, throughthe Eagle Rule and the Eagle Conservation Plan Guidance, has designed a mitigation strategy for eagle conservation that allows wind energy companies to obtain programmatic take permitsand comply with the Rule. However, the approach is challengedby a lack of data supporting scientifically rigorous strategies to mitigate eagle take, where mitigation is defined as efforts to avoid and minimize take, and compensate for unavoidable take. Because Golden Eagle mortality at most wind energy projects is infrequent, coordinated, collaborative research across multiple wind energy facilities is needed to improve our ability to produce scientifically robust mitigation strategies for eagle take at wind energy facilities. To meet this need, we have implemented a research framework that includes evaluating technologies intended to minimize eagle take and developing models for strategies to offset unavoidable eagle take, such as voluntary lead abatement, that can be quantified and verified. The impetus for these efforts is driven by the goal of improving implementation and compliance with the Eagle Rule. However, the results have benefits not just for Golden Eagles, but for other raptors and the ecological communities that include them. "

Human population increases, urbanization, and shifts in agricultural land use in California have likely affected, and will continue to affect, the states Swainsons Hawk population. To determine the density and abundance of breeding pairs of Swainsons Hawks in the state, and to track future population levels, we developed a statewide sampling framework for population monitoring. We used a stratified random sampling design to conduct surveys in 2005 and 2006. In 2005, we surveyed the known Swainsons Hawk range in California.

geoffrey_bedrosian@fws.gov,Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Golden Eagle Diets in Central Utah , Division of Migratory Birds,Geoffrey,"We investigated Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) food habitsin central Utah from 1970-2014 through the identificationof prey remains at 254 nest locations. We identified 147 prey species representing 26,769 individuals at a minimum, with the majority of species occurring at low frequencies. Golden Eagle diets in the Central Basin and Range were dominated by Black- tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), with cottontails (Sylvilagus species) and rock squirrels (Otospermophilus variegatus) also found frequently. Higher elevation nest locations in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains were associated with more diverse diets, and the top three prey species were rock squirrel, Yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris), and Black-tailed jackrabbit. Dietary breadth as measured by Levins formula was 2.10 in the Central Basin and Range, and 8.40 in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains. Preliminary results from partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA; controlling for sampling effort due to number of nest site visits) suggest that prey assemblages were associated with environmental variables, including: 1) forest cover and elevation versus shrub, grass, sagebrush, and pinyon cover; and 2) alfalfa, wetland, and crop cover versus grass. The proportion of rock squirrels in the diet of Golden Eagles appeared to increase in years where Black-tailed jackrabbit and cottontail use was lower. Our spatial analysis indicates that Golden Eagle diet varies within ecoregion boundaries and that prey availability is influenced by localized (four mile radius) environmental factors. "

brandesd@lafayette.edu,Availability of Roosting Sites Resultsin Eastward-Arcing Migration Route of Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) through the Great Plains of North America , Lafayette College  Easton,David,"The Great Plains of North America are characterized by a strong west to east gradient in precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation. Satellite tracking data show that during spring and autumn, Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) traveling between breeding grounds in Saskatchewan and wintering areas in northern South America follow an eastward-arcing route through this region, rather than flying directly over the semi-arid shortgrass prairie ecoregion. Because Turkey Vultures are adept at using thermal lift to power movements, we hypothesized that the arcing pattern of the satellite tracks resulted from limitations in the terrestrial environment, rather than selection based on atmospheric conditions. Using tracking annotation, we compared atmospheric and terrestrial conditions along the migration track with those along Directed Random Walks (DRWs) between south Texas and the breeding sites in Saskatchewan. We used the 2011 National Land Cover Dataset to analyze habitat near roost sites and movement points(> 5 km/hr) using the Normalized Difference in VegetationIndex (NDVI); pressure, temperature, and wind support at 30m; and two measures of thermal strength - thermal uplift velocity and boundary layer height. We found that in comparison tothe DRWs, the arcing migration route had significantly less thermal lift and lower boundary layer height, but greater NDVI greenness. Roost locations along the route had more tree cover, more water/wetlands, less shrub, and less agriculture than along the DRWs. This suggests that despite more conducive atmospheric conditions along the more direct path, Turkey Vultures selectedthe arcing route because of the greater availability of roost trees. Aerial images of roost sites showed vultures made extensive useof riparian corridors along the migration route, and such siteswere scarce farther west along the more direct route. Planting of shelterbelts following the dust bowl era, and the construction of communication towers have provided alternative roost sites. "

A mix of migratory and resident breeding populations occurs in the Northern Hemisphere while exclusively resident breeding populations occur in the Southern Hemisphere where migrants from northern populations winter. To understand how Peregrines evolved their near-global distribution, we formulated two alternative hypotheses of range expansion and colonization: isolation by distance and suspension of migration. The second hypothesis considered whether changes in migratory behavior or breeding dispersal led to the formation of a distinct population structure. Our results, based on eleven microsatellite loci, showed low to moderate genetic differentiation among North American reintroduced Peregrine Falcons and Eurasian migrants. There was also significant differentiation between northern migrants and southern residents in both the Old and New World. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA control region data revealed a lack of differentiation between the Old and New World Peregrine Falcons with significant differentiation between northern and southern populations. Worldwide genetic patterns derived from multiple analyses supported the isolation by distance hypothesis where populations that overlapped in distribution were less differentiated than populations without overlap. Even though suspension of migration was not supported, analysis with mitochondrial DNA detected directionality of historical gene flow in Old and New World northern migrants from west to east, and in Old World Peregrines from south to north.

ross@beringiasouth.org,Habitat Selection and Factors Influencing Nest Survival of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in South-Central Montana , Craighead Beringia South  Kelly,Ross,"Concern for Golden Eagle populations in western North America has recently intensified as a result of contradictory trend estimates and an increasing multitude of anthropogenic effects including extensive wind energy development. Understanding Golden Eagle resource requirements and factors influencing breeding success are essential to the creation of an effective conservation strategy. We assessed habitat selection across multiple spatial scales and tested the influence of environmental factors on nest survival of breeding Golden Eagles in south-central Montana. During the 20102013 nesting seasons, we located 45 nesting territories and confirmed 115 apparent nest initiations. We collected 15,182 GPS telemetry locations from 12 breeding Golden Eagles. Golden Eagles in our study area selected home ranges based on percent intermixed shrub and grassland and terrain ruggedness. Within their home ranges, Golden Eagles selected for western aspects, proximity to their nest site and proximity to prey habitat dependent on terrain ruggedness. Despite selection of rugged topography, we found Golden Eagle daily nest survival was negatively influenced by increased terrain ruggedness. Based on our results, we suggest that to maintain breeding pairs of Golden Eagles in areas similar to our study area, focus must be placed on preserving adequate prey habitat in and around rugged topography. However, territories with higher ruggedness may not be as productive; therefore, management goals should be clear and environmental factors influencing both habitat selection and reproductive success should be considered when possible.

Given this new threat, we initiated the first removal experiment to determine the feasibility of doing lethal removal and to test the impact of Barred Owls on site occupancy, survival and fecundity of spotted owls. From 2009-2014, we removed 104 territorial Barred Owls from the treated areas. We determined that lethal removal of Barred Owls was rapid, technically feasible, and cost-effective. There was no significant difference in any of the demographic or occupancy parameters for Spotted Owls between the treated and untreated areas prior to the removals. After treatment, there was a significant decrease in extinction rates and increase in survival rates and lambda for the Spotted Owls in treated versus untreated areas. The magnitude of the difference was biologically significant with Spotted Owls in treated areas increasing to a stable population (lambda = 1.029), while those in the untreated areas were in decline (lambda = 0.870). The rapid, positive effects on Spotted Owl demographics in our study area support the hypothesis that along with habitat conservation and management, Barred Owl removal may be able to slow or reverse Northern Spotted Owl population declines on at least a localized scale. We discuss the implications of this first removal experiment relative to recently initiated removal experiments throughout "

Factors that determine the outcome of interactions between parasites and their hosts include the intensity, duration, and type of immune responses mounted by a host to prevent a parasite invasion and infection. Too little response can lead to sickness, morbidity, and even death, but too great of a response can lead to immunopathology and wasting resources that would be better invested in other activities, such as reproduction. Thus, immune responses are part of important life- history trade-offs, and they ultimately contribute to an individuals evolutionary fitness. Quantifying differences in immunity among individuals and populations will contribute to our understanding of population dynamics. Immunity, however, is often overlooked in studies of raptors, in part because of costs, but also because "

Closely related to the White-bellied Sea Eagle(H. leucogaster) of Indomalaya and Australasia, it differs from most sea and fish eagles in possessing a plain or mottled brown adult plumage with no white areas. Endemic to the islands of Bougainville and Buka in Papua New Guinea and virtually all of the Solomon Islands, it inhabits small forested islets and reefs.

Every fall, American Kestrels make energetically expensive migrations to southern wintering grounds. We assessed a potential cause of American Kestrel population declines by examining changes in body condition (residualsof a mass-wing chord regression). If population level metricsof body condition declined over time, then this could suggestthat American Kestrel populations could be declining due tolack of food availability, resulting in low reproduction and/or poor survival. We developed a sex and age class-specific body condition index for American Kestrels captured at five migration monitoring sites from across North America. Specifically, we compared body condition trends within each age/sex group before and after declines in American Kestrel numbers in the late 1990s.

The park provides critical nesting habitat for federally endangered California Condors and watch-listed Prairie Falcons. However, foraging habitat is limited and studies show that the majority of foraging by California Condors and Prairie Falcons occurs on land surrounding the park. Due to the wide-ranging nature of these birds, it is important to recognize both the benefits and the challenges of managing these species across boundaries and on the broader landscape. Private landowners are a key partner in conservation by providing habitat, food, and water sources on their ranches, farms, and vineyards. Nonetheless, land management practices may expose wildlife to toxins not used within the national park. We are now beginning to explore whether condors and Prairie Falcons encounter rodenticides while foraging outside of the park.

Although raptor fatalities occur relatively infrequently at most wind energy facilities (typically fewer than 1.0 fatalities/megawatt/yr), these fatalities oftencarry greater regulatory or public perception implications than fatalities of songbirds, waterbirds, or gamebirds. Consequently, regulatory agencies often expect wind farm fatality monitoring to include a component that is specific to detecting raptor fatalities. Monitoring to detect low frequency events, particularly where needed to verify permit compliance, requires methodology with a high detection probability and low variance; however, conventional monitoring methods makes this prohibitively expensive.

This analysis supported a previous finding that migratory populations in western and eastern North America tend to remain separate, and are best analyzed as two distinct populations. The annualized migratory population estimate in western North America was approximately 12,500 HY falcons, and approximately 3,500 HY falcons for the migratory population in eastern North America. When accounting for mortality (10.4%) from the time that nestlings were marked and the arrival of HY falcons at trapping stations in the U.S., this analysis indicated that the annualized HY population was estimated to be greater than 13,800 migrant Peregrines in the eastern and western United States by the turn of the century. This estimate excludes some unknown proportion of the population that migrates through the central U.S., and the west coast of the U.S. and Canada. The Peregrine Falcon is no longer threatened or endangered in Canada or the U.S., and legal harvest of wild-caught migratory Peregrine Falcons for the practice of falconry is permitted. Using the US Fish and Wildlife harvest guideline (i.e., 5% of annual production), and the annualized estimate of HY falcons reported here (after mortality), it appears that the combined annual harvest limit in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico could be conservatively set at approximately 700 falcons without negative impact to the breeding population.

The Red-tailed Hawk is a continental species with resident populations in North America, Central America and Caribbean islands. Red-tailed Hawks have been well studied in North America but information from neotropical environments, including insular forms, is lacking. In Puerto Rico, the Red-tailed Hawk exhibits high abundance compared to mainland conspecifics. Our objectives were to derive population estimates and identify habitat characteristics and vegetation associated with Red-tailed Hawks in eastern Puerto Rico. We conducted point transects along primary and secondary roads in the Luquillo Mountains and surrounding lowlands. We surveyed 127 points along 19 routes visited eight times from November 2012 - July 2013. We recorded 953 sightings of soaring adult Red-tailed Hawks, 635 during the breeding season (December-April) and 318 during the non-breeding season (November, May-July). We used distance sampling to estimate density and detection probability. We derived estimates for the breeding season (0.0159 individuals/ ha, 95% CI = 0.0124-0.0206, CV = 130.03, P = 0.3) and non- breeding season (0.2051 individuals/ha, 95% CI = 0.0175-0.0241, CV = 8.19, P = 0.36). We used generalized linear mixed models to describe habitat associations with route as a fixed effect and visitas random effect. Best models ( AIC < 2) indicated Red-tailed Hawk density was negatively related to upland mature forest and positively related to temperature, mean slope, early successional vegetation and breeding season. Density of soaring adult Red- tailed Hawks was positively associated with temperature and slope, related to favorable thermal and updraft conditions, respectively. Our results indicate the Red-tailed Hawk of the Luquillo Mountains represent the highest known densities for the species across its range and in eastern Puerto Rico. "

Non- native hydrilla has spread across the U.S. since its anthropogenic introduction in the 1950s. Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM)is a deadly neurologic disease caused by a toxin-producing cyanobacterium (Aetokthonos hydrillicola) colonizing hydrilla. AVM toxin is transferred trophically from herbivorous waterbirds to raptors. We investigated effects of hydrilla on avian distribution, the species susceptibility range for AVM, and the Bald Eagle population sink on a southeastern U.S. reservoir. Over 75 AVM Bald Eagles have been documented at J. Strom Thurmond Lake (JSTL), a large reservoir on the Georgia-South Carolina border, since hydrillas appearance in 1995. In 2012-2015, we observed significantly higher densities of waterfowl and Bald Eagles at hydrilla sites versus non-hydrilla sites, and a lake-wide decline "

Two additional Golden Eagles found in the same region and also affected with this mite died soon after presentation to the hospital. Several other Golden Eagles have been reported by biologists in CA and NV since that time, but have not been live trapped and brought into captivity. Morphological characteristics of this mite strongly suggest a novel species of Micnemidocoptes mite.

horvath.marton@mme.hu,Estimating Key Parameters of Eagle Populations from Shed Feathers , Budapest,Marton,"Understanding the population dynamics of threatened raptor species is important for setting conservation priorities. The correct estimation of some key parameters for population modelling, such as adult survival rate, natal, and breeding dispersal is difficult, especially for rare and sensitive species. The Eastern ImperialEagle (Aquila heliaca) is a globally threatened large eagle, which has a small isolated population within the European Union in Hungary and surrounding countries. This population currently consists of 220 breeding pairs and has been monitored for over30 years. The extensive field surveys covered at least 90% of the breeding population annually in order to record the number of breeding pairs and breeding success. The lack of data on survival and dispersal has hampered effective population modelling. Moreover, in the last decade illegal poisoning was identified asthe main cause of eagle mortality in the study area, but it was not possible to assess the real extent of such crimes with traditional methods. To overcome these problems an intensive collection and genetic analyses of shed feathers from breeding adults and plucked feathers from chicks began in 2000. We built a DNA fingerprint database including more than 500 identified individuals, which enabled us to conduct genetic tracking. The average distance of natal dispersal (i.e. when the specimens identified as chicks were later found as breeding birds) was 111 km (n = 45). We found annual turnover of breeding birds was 12% (n = 249); significantly higher than would be expected for such a long-lived species. We recorded only six cases of breeding dispersal (i.e. switch between defined territories). Thus, territory fidelity was very high, so high annual turnover was probably due to non-natural mortality, like poisoning, not dispersal. "

Once a take limit is set and minimization and mitigation approaches agreed upon, additional actions may be necessary if the permitted take limit is exceeded. Accurately collecting and interpreting data to determine that take is difficult.

We recorded 5,091.4 total hr ( = 282.8  47.8 hrs/nest) of daylight video footage and documented 2,221 prey deliveries, identifying 2,017 (93.9%) of delivered prey items to species, genus, family,or class. Overall biomass consumed during the study was 189.2 3.0 kg. The five most delivered prey items accounted for74.7% of all deliveries and consisted of small mammals and reptiles. Small mammals accounted for 61.7% of total biomass, however reptiles (e.g., common garter snake [Thamnophis sirtalis]) accounted for a considerable proportion of biomass (19.2%). We documented a significant effect of brood size on the frequency of prey delivered to nests. Prey deliveries per nestling decreased as brood size increased (F2,17 = 3.75, P = 0.04); however, biomass did not differ (F2,17 = 0.18, P = 0.84) in relation to brood size. Provisioning rates during our study differed in biomass over 5-day interval periods from ~10 days old until fledging (~43 days old; grams/nestling/day; F6,70 = 2.12, P = 0.06).

drjohnson@usgs.gov,"Prey Availability, Diet Selection and Nesting Success of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in the Mojave Desert ", US Geological Survey  Henderson,Diego,"Within the Mojave Desert, rapid large-scale development ofsolar energy facilities has the potential to impact Golden Eagle demographics through loss of foraging habitat and prey base. Knowledge of how eagle productivity is influenced by variability in prey abundance and distribution is critical for understanding the effects of solar energy development. Unfortunately, such information is largely unavailable for the region. In this study we investigate prey availability, diet selection, and nesting success of Golden Eagles in the Mojave Desert during two nesting seasons (2014 and 2015). To examine prey availability, we conducted nocturnal spotlight surveys along 140 5-km transects. We documented diet selection using motion-activated trail cameras and by collecting prey remains at 20 active nests. We determined nest success by conducting occupancy and reproductive assessment surveys within 50 historic breeding areas and by evaluating nest camera data at active nests. Preliminary results indicate high spatial variability in prey species abundance and selection. Overall percent composition of available prey was highest for black-tailed jackrabbits (54%), followed by kangaroo rats (15%), birds (12%), other rodents (7%), desert cottontails (5%), carnivores (5%), reptiles (1%) and large mammals (1%). Percent composition of selected prey species from nest cameras was highest for black- tailed jackrabbits (47%), followed by desert cottontails (11%), rock squirrels (10%), small mammals (10%), reptiles (10%), birds (8%), and mesocarnivores (4%). Overall nest success was 47%. Productivity was 0.67 young per occupied breeding area, and mean brood size was 1.4 young per successful nest. We found no evidence that camera installation caused nest failures or influenced eagle behavior for any sites. Results from this project provide important baseline information that may be used to construct predictive models linking prey availability and abundance to Golden Eagle productivity across a changing Mojave Desert landscape.

Nevertheless, renewables have environmental effects of unknown scope for wildlife and habitats. To understand those effects, we used a combination of geneticand stable hydrogen isotope (2H) data, in conjunction with known-origin reference samples, to test hypotheses about the geographic extent and demographic consequence of mortality of Golden Eagles killed at a renewable energy facility in California, U.S.A. Genetic (microsatellite and SNP) data suggested that the eagles killed at the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) near Livermore, CA were from a single, panmictic population, whereas geospatial analyses of 2H values obtained from feathers suggested that 25% of these birds were immigrants to the population. The age structure of killed immigrant eagles was not random. Because the majority were young (2-year old birds), it suggests that some of the older eagles killed may have immigrated to the region when they were younger. Incorporation of these results into a demographic model indicates that Golden Eagle mortality at the APWRA is not compensatory, implying that populations at this renewable energy facility are sustained by long- distance continental-scale migration. These results indicate that management decisions concerning the impacts of renewable energy development may need to take into account the continental-scale impacts of local-scale activities. "

While mercury levels have been widely studiedin birds in general, little is known of mercury levels in wild birds of prey in particular. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed breast feathers from eight species of raptors banded at Hawk Ridge, Minnesota to evaluate mercury levels. Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus) averaged 3.26 ppm (n = 392), Merlins (Falco columbarius) 2.15 ppm (n = 137), Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus) 1.48 ppm (n = 30), Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) 1.44 ppm (n = 8), Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) 1.24 ppm (n = 222), Coopers Hawk (Accipiter cooperii) 1.11 ppm (n = 11), Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) 0.68 ppm (n = 88), and American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) 0.61 ppm (n = 71). Analysis of variance results show that after-hatch-year birds had significantly higher Hg levels (P < 0.05) than hatch-year birds for all species except for Coopers Hawk, Long-eared Owl and Peregrine Falcon. Based on known effects of mercury levels on American Kestrels, these results suggest that some individuals migrating through central flyways may be at risk to detrimental effects of mercury. "

pskolar@yahoo.com,Factors Influencing Wind Turbine Collisions and Indirect Effects of Wind Energy Development on Non-Eagle Raptor Species , Raptor Research Center  Boise State University  Boise,Patrick,"As the production of wind energy increases worldwide to address concerns regarding climate change, adverse effects of turbines and development activities have been documented for many avian groups, especially raptors. The response of different species to wind energy development, however, has been shown to be highly variable and dependent upon a number of factors. The risk of collisions with turbines is influenced by characteristics of thewind energy project area and often varies by age- and life-history stage. While some commonly occurring species in a given area are more frequently found as collision fatalities, the risk of collisionsis influenced by more than abundance alone, such as by species- specific flight and hunting behaviors. Indirect effects on raptor species may also occur when birds are displaced from foragingand nesting habitats due to avoidance of turbines or disturbance associated with operations and maintenance of the wind energy facility and associated infrastructure. This presentation will provide a broad overview of the ways in which wind energy development can impact non-eagle raptor populations and will discuss the factors that contribute to these effects. "

zkuspa@ucsc.edu,Looking Beyond Mortalities: Lead Exposure and Stress in the California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) , University of California  Santa Cruz,Zeka,"Lead poisoning is the leading mortality factor for the critically endangered California Condor. Nonetheless, sub-lethal effects from the repeated lead exposures they experience are not well understood. Generally, lead exposure impairs the vertebrate stress response, and elevated stress can reduce avian reproduction and survival. Accurately evaluating changes in stress hormone release via blood sampling in wild birds is challenging, but measuring stress hormones in fecal and feather samples as a proxy for stress has shown promise as a non-invasive approach in some species. However, since the stress hormone response and hormone metabolism can differ widely among species, methods to assess the stress hormone response must be validated on a species-by-species basis. Here we report development and validation of methods to assess condor-specific stress hormone response and metabolism, including hormone metabolite stability, using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Preliminary data on condor stress responses indicate a high degree of variation within the wild population. Serially collected condor urates show an elevation in circulating stress hormone that increased 2 to 65-fold within 2 hours following a defined stressor (i.e., trapping and handling). Additionally the ELISA used appears to be more susceptible to sample matrix interferences than the RIA. We will build on these findings to investigate lead-induced alterations in the condor stress response and potential impacts to California Condor recovery. "

The Chihuahuan Desert population is currently threatened by the extensive conversion of the species breeding habitat from open desert grasslands to irrigated farmland. However, why the species has not been able to occupy apparently-available breeding habitat in the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico and southwestern U.S. remains a mystery. The study of natal dispersal of Aplomado Falcons may reveal mechanisms of habitat selection and help to identify breeding habitat suitable for protection. To evaluate this, we are using Argos 5g-PTT satellite transmitters deployed on three fledglings from different nests (two males and one female) in Chihuahua (Mexico) in May 2015. One transmitter failed 7 days (male 40 days old) after being deployed, apparently related to a predation event.

ediblenest@gmail.com,"Ecological Separation in Serpent Eagles (Spilornis) of the Andaman Islands, India ", Slim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History  Coimbatore Tamil Nadu,Shirish,"The two serpent eagle (Spilornis) species in the Andaman Islands are believed to be ecologically separated with respect to habitats and distribution. The Andaman Serpent Eagle (Spilornis elgini)is endemic to the Andaman Islands, and is believed to be widely distributed in a majority of inland forests. The Crested Serpent Eagle (Spilornis cheela) is believed to be restricted to coastalforests. When this hypothesis was examined through occupancy surveys we found interesting results. The Andaman Serpent Eagle with its detection probability (0.116  0.002) was found to be more abundant (encounter rate: 0.283) compared to the Crested Serpent Eagle (detection probability: 0.0330.001; encounter rate: 0.106). Andaman Serpent Eagles were found to be more common in deciduous forests (37% of total sightings) and were never encountered in plantations. Whereas Crested Serpent Eagles were encountered in all the identified habitats but were more common in mangroves (32% of total sightings). Of the 13 cells (25 km2 each) surveyed, both species were encountered in more than 61%. In one cell neither of the species were encountered. On mapping the sightings of both species, we found that these sympatric species have significant overlap in their distribution and habitat. Based upon the co-existence of Andaman Serpent Eagles and Crested Serpent Eagles, we reject the null hypothesis of the ecological separation among these two Spilornis species. "

cmcclure@Peregrinefund,Demography of the American Kestrel Lends Insight into Potential Causes of Population Declines and Suggests Future Research Needs , Boise,Christopher,"Population declines are emergent properties of demographic processes, but not all processes affect the growth (or decline) of a population equally. Demographic models often are used to identify the processes that most affect the growth rate of a population and may identify processes that should be targeted for management or further research. Raptors are typically long-lived species and are generally considered survivor species because changes in survival rates tend to affect population sizes more strongly than changesin reproduction. Many populations of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) have declined steadily over the past several decades,but the underlying causes remain unknown. Although there are a myriad of hypothesized drivers of kestrel declines, the hypotheses tested to date have been related to reproduction or threats on the breeding grounds. Here, we use data from thousands of banded kestrels as part of nest-box programs in Florida and Idaho to examine American Kestrel demography and test the hypothesis that, like other raptors, the growth rate of a typical population is more sensitive to changes in survival than to changes in fecundity. Our results support this hypothesis and suggest that future research should examine threats to American Kestrels during the post- fledging, migratory, and wintering periods. "

brycerobinson@u.boisestate.edu,"The Implication of Climate Change on the Diet of a Key Arctic Predator, the Gyrfalcon ", Boise State University  Boise,Bryce,"Climate change is predicted to impact the Arctic ecosystem in many ways. This has the power to cause ecosystem disruption with conservation implications for affected organisms, but also provides signals for the impacts of climate change on a broader scale. In the life-history of raptors, peak resource use occurs during the brood rearing period. Any disruption in prey populations during this time may impact the ability of raptors to raise young successfully. The Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) depends on Ptarmigan as its main prey for much of the year, but uses alternative prey during the brief Arctic summer to supplement its diet during breeding, but the relative importance of alternative prey items for raising young is unclear. It is important to develop a complete understandingof the balance between Ptarmigan and alternate prey in the diet during brood rearing, as prey populations may experience changes in distribution and abundance due to climate change. Whetheror not the Gyrfalcon has the ability to shift between prey sources and maintain the ability to produce offspring offers insight into how the species may manage climate induced changes in prey populations. In 2014 and 2015, we placed 23 Reconyx PC800 motion-activated cameras in Gyrfalcon nests on the Alaskan Seward Peninsula to record prey deliveries during brood rearing. We catalogued prey items to assess the relationship between breeding phenology, diet, and nest success.

As the recovering Bald Eagle population expands, we speculate that breeding areas along the Great Lakes are experiencing chronically low reproduction relative to those inland because of higher concentrations of contaminants in Great Lakes fisheries. We hypothesize nestlings may be initially exposed in ovo, and colonizers exposed through diet leading to reduced reproductive fitness. To assess the reproductive fitness of shoreline versus inland pairs, we used productivity data from 19812010. We used two parameters, length of site occupancy and decadal success rate. Length of site occupancy was calculated as the average years that one breeding pair occupied one breeding area between changeovers, and decadal success rate as the number of years that young were produced per number of years that the breeding area was occupied. Length of site occupancy and decadal success rates significantly decreased in lakes Michigan and Huron from 6.84 "
sslater@hawkwatch.org,Inter-Annual Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) Nest Use Patterns in Central Utah and Implications for Long-Term Nest Protection , HawkWatch International,Steve,"Temporal nest protections are regularly used by land managers to reduce the likelihood of raptor nest disturbance or abandonment, but without consistency. We assessed alternate nest use (i.e., egg laying) and nest spacing at 28 Golden Eagle territories in central Utah monitored for 25 years or more between 1976 and 2013. Territories contained 18 nests ( = 2.89), and average spacing between alternate nests was 0.5 km. Inspection of 21 territories monitored consecutively for 2638 years suggested individual nests were used on average every 3.26 years, egg laying at anynest within the territory averaged 1.83 years, and nest switching occurred between 43.3% of egg laying events. Assessment of nest histories suggested protecting individual nests for 7 years when alternate nests were not considered, or protecting all nests withina territory for 4 years since the last documented use of any nest when alternate nests were considered, would have protected > 90% of all inter-annual nesting events observed in the dataset. These temporal protections are longer than individual nest protections commonly applied by land management agencies (e.g., 3 years), but shorter than those suggested by Golden Eagle data collected in southern Idaho in an area with more alternate nests per territory. We recommend that land managers take a territory approach "

In response to legal actions, in 2005 Alameda County established an Avian Protection Plan and a Scientific Review Committee (SRC) to recommend mitigation measures and oversee implementation and monitoring of its plan. Mitigation measures included power pole retrofits, winter shutdown of wind turbines, phased repowering to modern turbines, removal of hazardous turbines, and adaptive management beginning in 2009 shouldthe other measures prove unsatisfactory. Settlement of legal actions in 2007 added a 50% fatality reduction target for Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), and Western Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), but eliminated repowering as a requirement. Implementation of mitigation measures proved haphazard and inadequate depending on wind company compliance: many power pole retrofits are still pending, the SRC-recommended 4-month winter shutdown period was never achieved, and most hazardous turbine removals were delayed until 2008 or later. The most effective mitigation measure was hazardous turbine removal. This, along with repowering, i.e. replacing many smaller old- generation wind turbines with fewer, larger modern wind turbines in conjunction with research designed to produce collision hazard "
nrsmith@ducks.org,Factors Affecting Landscape Level Nest Site Selection and Success of Louisiana Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) , School of Renewable Natural Resources  Louisiana State University  Baton Rouge,Nickolas,"The number of Louisiana nesting Bald Eagles has increased exponentially since the mid-1970s, but active nests have remained relatively concentrated within an area of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain referred to as the basin. However, as the number of nests continues to grow, nesting is expected to expand into new areas. To manage an expanding population, it is imperative to first determine parameters that influence nest-site selection. To evaluate site selection and success, we conducted GIS-based analysis to evaluate geographic variables such as land cover, and proximityto water, human activity, and other nests. Our analysis was based on 387 active nests from the 20072008 winter nesting season, and 387 random sites evaluated to compare available habitat.Our results suggest that success of a nest within the basin was not greatly influenced by the physical characteristics around a site,but sites with the highest probability of being selected for nesting generally had a higher probability of success. Initial selection of a nest site was most influenced by distance to road, houses per km2, and land cover within 3 km but the influence of these variables varied between sites within and outside the basin. Based on our results, managers should be able to make informed decisions about effects of future developments, conservation activities, and human use on current and future nesting habitat. "

Golden Eagles in shrub-steppe habitats may be vulnerable to disturbance from recreation because canyons are popular areas for non-motorized and motorized (off-highway vehicle, OHV) recreation. We tested the hypothesis that recreation affects eagle breeding biology by monitoring eagle behavior and reproduction in relation to recreation volume and activity, and landscape features associated with recreation (e.g., trails and camping sites). Territory occupancy was lower at sites with higher OHV volumes. At occupied territories, early season volumes of pedestrians and other non-motorized recreationists negatively influenced the probability of a pair laying eggs. Forpairs that did lay eggs, nest survival was negatively affected by interval-specific OHV volume. In addition, adult nest attendance, the strongest behavioral predictor of nest survival, was associated negatively with the volume of pedestrians. Direct observations of nesting eagles and recreationists revealed that most pedestrians in eagle nesting areas arrived using motorized vehicles. These results suggest that motorized recreation both reduces territory occupancy, "

The Tongass National Forest is about 77,000km2 and has some of the largest tracts of remaining old growth temperate rainforest forestin western North America. The study area is an island archipelago and many of the islands have few prey that goshawks typically hunt. We radiotagged adult nesting goshawks at 41 nesting areas (31 males, 32 females) and used aerial radiotelemtry to locate birds across all months. Adult males make few long distance movements, even outside of the nesting season. However, some adult females make significant movements and successfully nest with a different male >100 km between years. Mean tracking time for males was 15.4 months and 22.7 months for females with some birds being tracked for ~72 months. We used program MARK with a known fates model to estimate monthly survival rates. Mean annual survival for males was 0.59 and no males changed territories among years; all were resident.

When financial resources are limited and nest sites are the currency for scientific and management endeavors, researchers frequently design surveys to detect as many nests as possible. However, these efforts may come at the expense of a probabilistic design necessary for unbiased inference on the demography and habitat use of raptors. We sought to balance the need for a robust nest sample while using a randomized sampling design for a 2015 helicopter survey for Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) nests in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Using available historic nesting data, we developed predictive models of nest site occurrence based on topographic indices, land cover, and other environmental attributes.

In South Africa, raptors display higher rates of occurrence in protectedareas than in non-protected areas, likely due to anthropogenic factors such as persecution and habitat transformation. The Martial Eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus) however, in addition to steady declines across its range, has also shown alarming declines in protected areas such as the Kruger National Park. To understand these declines, we studied the habitat use, breeding, and dispersal behavior of the species. Martial Eagles held territories averaging 110 km2 and habitat factors such as drainage line density influenced their behavior and distribution. Individuals that crossed into unprotected landscapes were at increased risk of mortality,and their behavior was greatly influenced by fragmented and transformed habitats. As Kruger National Park was a protected area proclaimed under historical influences, the parks landscape, size, and shape is unlikely ideal throughout its coverage for such a wide- ranging predator. Martial Eagles are also sporadic breeders with low productivity, which increases their vulnerability to stochastic processes on the population. Following a post nesting dependency phase of 39 mo, juvenile birds disperse over large areas beyond the safety of protected areas and often traverse into neighboring countries where they are at increased risk of unnatural mortality. Our findings demonstrate the importance of appropriately sized "

hswalter@gmail.com,Tyrannosaurus rex and the Puzzling Reversed Sexual Size Dimorphism in Raptors , Geography  University of California  Los Angeles,Hartmut,"At least 14 different hypotheses have been proposed overmany centuries to explain the often astonishing size differences between males (smaller) and females (larger) in many birdsof prey and owls. None has found universal acceptance and research concerning reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSSD)has continued. Is there a single causal factor responsible for the evolution of extreme RSSD in some bird-hunting hawks, falcons, and owls? I have previously called for a holistic approach to the RSSD phenomenon (Walter 1979) and will now present more specific data and rationale pointing to a single physiological process underlying the evolution and adaptation of RSSD. Recent findings on the importance of the leg medulla in Tyrannosaurus rex have pointed to the essential role of the leg bone in birds generatingthe calcium needed for eggshell formation. It is this bone that is uniquely stressed during the impact of a bird-hunting raptor when hitting its prey. No other birds face this often violent event because only raptors hit and grab prey with their feet. My thesis postulates that raptor females have grown larger than their males in order to better protect the fragile nature of the medulla anatomy and the entire reproductive apparatus. "

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious and fatal forms of the disease that once established, can spread rapidly through wild flocks, backyard poultry operations, and commercial poultry farms and facilities. The U.S. has the strongest avian influenza surveillancein the world, and Federal, state, and industry partners respond quickly and decisively when disease outbreaks occur. Beginningin December of 2014 and increasing through today (30 June 2015), HPAI viruses have been reported in some commercial poultry facilities, backyard poultry flocks, captive wild birds,and free-ranging wild birds within the U.S. Two strains of HPAI (H5N2 and H5N8) have been reported in the Pacific Flyway, whereas the H5N2 strain has been the primary variant reportedin the Mississippi Flyway. To date, over 48,000,000 poultry (primarily chickens and turkeys) have been affected by these HPAI outbreaks. Also, 5 incidents of these HPAI strains infecting and killing captive raptors (i.e., falconry birds) have been reported. During the last 7 months, ongoing surveillance of wild birds has been conducted and a total of 84 free-ranging birds have been confirmed to be infected with HPAI. Various species of waterfowl (93%) and raptors (7%) account for these birds, which were found in 14 states.

", Natural Resources Research Institute  University of Minnesota  Duluth,Gerald,"Migration phenology shifts in response to climate change have been observed across numerous taxa from insects to songbirds, yet it is unknown whether this pattern holds for many ecologically and culturally important species of raptors. Migrating raptorshave been counted at Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory in Duluth, Minnesota every fall for more than 40 years (19722014), offering a unique opportunity to explore migration trends for many species over a time period coinciding with rapid climate warming. We analyzed changes in migration phenology for nine species of raptors from 1972 to 2014, and five species from 1991 to 2014by regressing the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile migration dates against year for each species.

falconresearch@gmail.com,The Osprey Nest Excluder for Cellular Towers: A Case Study Aimed at Reducing Nest Site Conflicts and Bird Strike Hazards around Airports , Osprey Nest Excluders,Clifford,"The use of cellular communication towers as nesting structure by Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) has increased dramatically in the past decade, allowing Ospreys to exploit increasingly urban habitats. This leads to conflict when the presence of Osprey nests prevent upgrade and maintenance of equipment, since human disturbance at active nests is prohibited under The Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Airport safety concerns are also heightened, as risks for bird strikes increase with nearby Osprey nesting and the fledging of young. Furthermore, nesting on cellular towers can pose additional risks for Ospreys, including combustion of nest material, entanglement potential in coaxial and electrical wires, and potentially adverse effects from exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation emitted by communication infrastructure. We describe the development and efficacy of an Osprey nest exclusion device, that when paired with providing safe alternative nest structures, allows year round access to cellular communication equipment, reduces bird strike hazards around airports, and aids Osprey conservation.

More recently, lead poisoning from ingested lead-bullet fragments and shotgun pellets has been identified as the leading cause of death in California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus), leading to a ban of lead ammunition within the California Condor Recovery Zone. Another on-going study on Common Ravens (Corvus corax) and Bald Eagles in Wyoming has shown a direct correlation between very high blood-lead levels and the on- set of rifle hunting season. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence showing that lead toxicity is still prevalent in the environment and mounting data points to fragmented rifle bullets as the source. "

We studied the tail molt of wild sub-adult and adult Great Gray Owls in western Wyoming between 2013 and 2015. Replacement of rectrices occurred in what is known as a simultaneous or rapid, complete molt over the course of several days, rendering the owls temporarily tail- less.

christinahartmann@u,The Use of Hydrogen Stable Isotopes in Claws to Distinguish between Migratory and Resident Birds in a Partial Migrant Population of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) , Department of Biological Sciences and Raptor Research Center  Boise State University  Boise,Christina,"Comparative studies of partial migrants are useful for understanding the consequences of migration strategies, butwhen migrants and residents are sympatric, it can be difficultto identify whether a bird migrated or not. Ratios of Hydrogen and Deuterium in precipitation (Dp) vary along a latitudinal gradient, and birds feeding at different latitudes may incorporate this latitudinal variation in D into their tissues. We evaluated whether D of keratin in claw tissue (Dc), which reflects theD in the diet 34 months prior, could be used to distinguish between migratory and resident American Kestrels in southwestern Idaho. From 20132015 we captured adult and nestling Kestrels during the breeding (AprJul) and winter (NovFeb) seasons, marked each bird with a band, and collected a small claw sample. Claw samples were washed, weighed, and D was analyzedusing a mass spectrometer. If a Kestrel was recaptured in a subsequent season (e.g., breeding and winter) we considered itto be a known resident, otherwise all adults were assigned an unknown migratory status. We found that nestling Dc was significantly depleted compared to adult Dc. For adults, Dcof known residents captured in spring were similar to Dc of known residents captured in winter and did not differ by year, suggesting a consistent local signature in Dc. Dc of unknown Kestrels caught in winter were not significantly different than known residents suggesting that unknown kestrels winteringin the study area were not migrants from northern breedingareas. However, Dc of unknown kestrels caught in spring were significantly enriched compared to known resident Dc Kestrels, suggesting that many unknown Kestrels that were breedingon the study site wintered in more southern latitudes prior to nesting. These results suggest that Dc could be a powerfultool in distinguishing between migrant and resident Kestrels. "

Ingestion of SGARs leads to the inhibition of vitamin K clotting factors essential to normal blood coagulation, which at lethal doses causes internal hemorrhage and death. SGARs provide a fatal dose to rodents after only a single ingestion of bait and have relatively long half-lives compared to their less lethal counterpart, warfarin.Not surprisingly, avian predators that extensively hunt small rodents are at risk of secondary poisoning, including the Barn Owl that is currently listed as a Species at Risk in Canada. For the past 3 decades, raptor-monitoring programs worldwide have demonstrated a generally increasing trend in the number of birds exposed to SGARs. In this study, we used SGAR residue data "
mkjensen@mix.wvu.edu,An Improved Mechanical Owl for Capture of Nesting Accipiter Hawks , Division of Forestry and Natural Resources  West Virginia University  Morgantown,Meghan,"Logistical constraints can reduce the efficacy of samplingwildlife populations; this is especially true for predator species that occur in relatively low densities. The use of live lure birdsis a common trapping technique for secretive North American Accipiters. However, this method creates numerous challenges including building and maintaining housing for the lure bird,the cost of feeding and equipment, the difficulty of transportto nest sites, and the potential danger during trapping to both lure bird and targeted wild birds. Mechanical owls have been used in the past to trap wild nesting raptors, but with limited success compared to using live lure birds. Thus, there is a need to advance mechanical lures to improve trapping success and further facilitate research. We constructed an improved mechanical lure bird from a salvaged Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) that has a greater diversity of movement than previously reported lure birds. We attempted to capture 23 Accipiters during the 2015 nesting season using this owl in conjunction with playback calls. We successfully captured 20 individuals (87%) and all exceptone was captured within an hour of trap set-up. Additionally, over 50% of targeted birds were captured less than 5 minutes after becoming visible to researchers. We hope that this newlure bird design can be used in future trapping efforts fornesting birds of prey to reduce costs, mitigate logistical issues, and simultaneously maintain or improve trapping efficiency.

cyaneus87@gmail.com,Body Size and Dietary Niche of Sympatric Northern Boobooks (Ninox japonica) and Oriental Scops Owls (Otus sunia) in Korea , Lab of Wildlife ecology and Management  Graduate School  Department of Forest Sciences  Seoul National University,Han-Kyu,"Two insectivorous forest owls, the Northern Boobook and the Oriental Scops Owl, are among common breeding migrants in the Republic of Korea. However, very limited ecological informationis available on these nocturnal raptors. In this study, I focused on their diets via stable isotope analysis (SIA), and related to inter- and intra-specific body size. SIA showed significant distinctions between the two species, both in carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Northern Boobooks had higher values in nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios, and greater variance in carbon isotope ratios than Oriental Scops Owls. According to the multi-source mixing models, Northern Boobooks mainly consumed vertebrate prey, especially birds. Oriental Scops Owls utilized mainly ground insects followed by birds, mice, and moths. Each individual owls overall body size index was extracted from principal component analysis, and compared with individual trophic level (nitrogen isotope ratio). Only Oriental Scops Owls showed significant correlation with smaller individuals consuming higher trophic level diets. In conclusion, Northern Boobooks and Oriental Scops Owls demonstrated distinct food niche separation in a sympatric habitat. In particular, the larger bodied Northern Boobooks occupieda higher trophic level with more flexible foraging habits, and selected diverse prey sources from forests to open environments, whereas the smaller Oriental Scops Owl belonged to a lower trophic level and was a more specialized forager relying on forest ecosystems. Furthermore, individual trophic level was found to be related to body size only for the more sexually dimorphic Oriental Scops Owls, but not in the less dimorphic or monomorphic Northern Boobooks. These findings partially support the small male hypothesis, in Oriental Scops Owls that smaller males are efficient foragers, which is beneficial in reproductive success and thus more adaptive in raptors with reversed sexual dimorphism.

kevin_kritz@fws.gov,Preferential Raptor Predation on Rozol- Poisoned Black-tailed Prairie Dogs in Colorado during Winter , US Fish and Wildlife Service  Denver,Kevin,"Several diurnal raptor species forage on black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) during autumn and winter. Applicationsof first generation anticoagulant rodenticides, Rozol Prairie Dog Bait (active ingredient chlorophacinone) and Kaput-D Prairie Dog Bait (active ingredient diphacinone) to prairie dog colonies during this time of the year raises concern about secondary poisoning of raptors through consumption of contaminatedprey. We documented raptor foraging and above ground prairie dog activity on two Rozol Prairie Dog Bait-treated wards andone untreated ward of a prairie dog colony during January and February, 2011. Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus), Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), Ferruginous Hawks (Buteo regalis), a Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus) and Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus) were observed at the study colony post Rozol Prairie Dog Bait application but only Ferruginous Hawks and Red-tailed Hawks were observed feeding on prairie dogs post-Rozol application. Ferruginous Hawks homed-in on prairie dogs in the Rozol-treated wards while ignoring overtly healthy prairie dogs in the adjacent untreated ward. The selective predation on vulnerable (poisoned) prey follows foraging theory postulating that raptors should hunt such that they minimize their energy expenditureand maximize their net energy status. Given preferential predation on poisoned prairie dogs and the toxicities of the first generation anticoagulant rodenticides, we hypothesize that successive foraging on intoxicated prairie dogs will result in adverse effects to raptors. Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) also are known to forage on prairie dog colonies and hence other raptor species in addition to those observed in this study may be at risk when rodenticides are applied to control prairie dogs. To date, monitoring efforts at prairie dog colonies treated with rodenticides have been inadequate to document adverse secondary toxic effects on raptors and other wildlife species. "

It remains enigmatic and little studied species, particularly its breeding biology. Its population trend appears to be decreasing, but dueto its large distribution, the species is listed as Least Concernby the IUCN. Over a three year period, 20122014, we made observations of six nests from a presumed same pair in the Cayo District of Belize to better understand the breeding biologyof the species and to potentially solve the mystery of why the northern population is migratory. Two nests were studied in 2012, one nest in 2013, and three nests in 2014. In 2012, one young fledged from the first nest and two young of near fledgling age were observed in the second nest, but fledging was not observed. In 2013, two young successfully fledged, but we suspect thatthis was a second nest this year. In 2014, we documented three different nests from the presumed same pair, which successfully fledged five young from all three nests. This represents the first observation of a triple brooding for Hook-Billed Kites, whichhas only been documented in a few raptor species and is usually due to failure of a prior nest, though not in this case. High productivity in certain years may be a response to increased snail detectability and abundance, but further research is needed. Prey at these nests was 100% snails of two species, Orthalicus princeps and a smaller unknown snail species. O. princeps represented99% of the diet at all nests. These kites have a very specializeddiet leading to high vulnerability of being impacted by human activities, such as climate change, habitat degradation or pollution. "

During this time, American Kestrels have advanced their nesting period by about 11 d.

Ospreys have been a focal point of conservation and study since their extensive decline from 19501970. While the majority of populations in the U.S. have recovered, breeding densities in many areas are variable; with several areas unoccupied despite the apparent existence of high quality habitat. Distance to human disturbance, prey abundance, water quality and characteristics, distance to other raptor nests, and land use and land cover (LULC) are known to affect Osprey nesting success. In light of increasing human encroachment on Osprey breeding habitat in Long Valley, Idaho, we set out to evaluate relationships among nest site characteristics and Osprey nesting success. We used multivariate generalized linear models with model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of LULC and nest site characteristics on Osprey nesting success. Our results suggest a correlation between higher percentages of shrub/grassland and agricultural cover and reduced osprey nesting success. Agricultural and shrub/grassland land cover classes were found to include lands featuring current or past cattle grazing activity. Our results support previous studies reporting correlations among cattle grazing and reduced nesting success of fishing birds. We suggest further studies over additional breeding seasons, and experimental approaches, are needed to isolate and assess potential mechanisms associated with reduced Osprey nesting success on grazing lands.
