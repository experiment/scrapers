Aspinwall,Lisa,lisa.aspinwall@psych.utah.edu,UTXi5tobJI,Can Unhealthy Behaviors Amplify Genetic Disease Risk?: The Motivational Implications of Beliefs About Gene-Behavior Interactions in High-Risk Families,"Poster Board#: A240Among 124 high-risk family members receiving melanoma genetic counseling, beliefs that genetic risk could be increased by unhealthy behaviors and decreased by healthy behaviors were endorsed more strongly than deterministic beliefs, remained high following genetic counseling, and predicted motivation to adhere to prevention and screening recommendations, particularly among mutation carriers."
Aspiras,Olivia,olivia.aspiras@utoledo.edu,CrPkv0SZDJ,Gender Effects in the Framing of Health Messages,"Poster Board#: A137Gender plays an important role in health. This study investigated the interplay between gender and message framing. Females reported higher exercise intentions after a gain-framed message than a loss-framed one, and this was partially mediated by attitudes and norms. Males tended to show the opposite framing pattern, albeit less strongly."
Atherton,Olivia,oeatherton@ucdavis.edu,oanCfOoqzL,"Individual Differences in Traits, Cognition and Behavior Predict Adolescent Substance Use Initiation: A Longitudinal Study of Mexican-Origin Youth","Poster Board#: P109This study examined the effects of individual differences on substance use initiation in adolescence. Results show that individual differences have both protective (effortful control) and harmful (intent to use, deviance, access to substances) effects on early initiation. Reseearchers discussed moderating and mediating pathways, with implications for future research and prevention."
Atir,Stav,ssa62@cornell.edu,2DgpsLu8RL,Gaining Knowledge Increases Claims of Invented Knowledge,"Poster Board#: A268When do people claim knowledge of concepts and terms that are entirely invented? We find that this overclaiming behavior increases as people gain true knowledge in the relevant domain. At the end (vs. beginning) of the semester, students overclaimed more knowledge of invented course-related concepts, but not of course-unrelated concepts."
Atkins,Chelsea,chelseaatkins@slu.edu,sqZdOpeeqt,Sharing the Pie: Zero-Sum Beliefs Moderate SES and Prejudice,"Poster Board#: A323Zero-sum beliefs moderated the relationship of socioeconomic status (SES) and prejudice. At high levels of zero-sum beliefs, White Americans reported more desired social distance from Asians and African Americans as their subjective SES increased. At low levels of zero-sum beliefs, there was no relationship between subjective SES and social distance."
Aubrey,Rickey,rickeyaubrey@yahoo.com,wnzfwoeqx6,Holding Out For Tradition: A Closer Look at Virginity in College,Poster Board#: H060This study sought to distinguish the differences in beliefs about virginity from individuals with different cultural backgrounds.

Auger,Beatrice,auger.beatrice@gmail.com,U1e8dxWJay,Are All Animals Equal?: Testing How Contact with Different Animal Types is Associated to Identification with Animals,"Poster Board#: E139This study examined how contact with different animals predicts identification with animals, which was more strongly linked to contact with pets than to contact with farm animals or wild animals. Positive emotions during contact specifically predicted identification with animals. These results are consistent with the cross-group friendship literature."
Auster-Gussman,Lisa,Auste010@umn.edu,fdxgXs6cQQ,Diet and Exercise in a Social World,"Four presentations highlight social psychological factors that affect health behaviors. The talks cover cultural notions of weight and health, implicit theories of weight, normative perceptions and body size (i.e. fat suit) manipulations in predicting health behaviors such as exercise and healthy eating as well as weight loss.TALKS(full abstracts can be found in the document section below)Putting on Weight Stigma: The Implications of Wearing a Fat Suit for Eating Behavior and Psychological Well-BeingUnderstanding the Prevalence and Consequences of Implicit Theories of Weight in the U.S.: Insights from a Nationally Representative SampleWhat is Health and Why Do We Even Care?: Values and Mindsets Regarding Health Differ Across Gender, Race and EthnicityNormative Perceptions of Eating and Exercise"
Austin,Adrienne,abaustin@iastate.edu,tGHfimxboM,Life Narratives and the Prosocial Personality,"Poster Board#: I302Life narratives reflect individual identities. In a two-part study, researchers expected that prosocial personality would predict focus of life stories. Results indicated that individuals with prosocial attributes described their life experiences in terms of relationships rather than personal achievements. Prosocial attributes also predicted redemptive themes and story generation ease."
Avelar,Daniela,davelar@fandm.edu,sScHpiRmpf,Tell Me Why Youre Texting!: Effect of Cell Phone Use on Interpersonal Interactions,"Poster Board#: H256A two-part study investigated whether providing an excuse for texting mitigates negative effects associated with cell phone use.

Axt,Jordan,Jordan.axt@gmail.com,IroASftL8I,The Reputational Consequences of Replication,"Poster Board#: P159Replication is vital for increasing scientific accuracy, but could also have reputational consequences for researchers. In three surveys (N = 4,939), U.S. adults judged scientists based upon their research and attempts to replicate their work. Reputational assessments reflected how scientists pursued knowledge rather than the results of replications."
Babbitt,Bryn,brynbabbitt@gmail.com,w8BsnniyyP,In a Barbie World: On the Implications of Sex-Typed Environments,"Poster Board#: H107Gender essentialism maintains that differences between women and men are biologically-rooted. We found that participants with motivation to maintain gender-inequities endorsed essentialism when shown sex-typed faces, but not when shown androgynous faces. Therefore, endorsement of essentialism depends both on motivation to maintain inequity and exposure to evidence of biological sex-differences."
Babbitt,Laura,Laura.babbitt@tufts.edu,2L8uEcPGLV,Individual and Institutional Factors that Predict Dehumanization and Abuse of Workers by Supervisors,"Poster Board#: P077We examined attitudes of workers and supervisors in 14 South Asian factories. Female workers reported lower life satisfaction and worse health than male workers. Among supervisors, cognitive load was associated with more dehumanization and tolerance of verbal/ sexual harassment; however, a growth mindset and greater organizational accountability counteracted these trends."

Baek,Elisa,ebaek@asc.upenn.edu,rKPunW6o7z,Personal Distress and Neural Mechanisms of Social Influence,Poster Board#: H335This study examined whether individual differences in personal distress can predict behavioral conformity in an fMRI social influence task. Findings provide insight about neural mechanisms involved when people who experience high self-focused emotional response to uncomfortable social settings change their behavior to conform to popular opinion.
Bagheri,Leyla,leylabagheri@cmail.carleton.ca,lPXFo24jvi,Situational and Interpersonal Variation in Psychological Need Satisfaction and Its Relation to Wellbeing,"Poster Board#: P129We examined whether different people derive the same psychological need satisfaction from a given situation, and how these perceptions relate to wellbeing and personality. Although the situation played a larger role than individual differences, general need satisfaction and neuroticism still predicted situational experiences. Situational need satisfaction uniquely predicted situational wellbeing."
Baguley,Chantelle,chantelle.baguley@uqconnect.edu.au,D9xCNM7BPJ,The Dual Effect of Jury Instruction Simplification,"Poster Board#: E205Three studies examined the dual effect of jury instruction simplification. While simplification enhanced mock jurors application of the instructions to decide a verdict, it also led mock jurors to choose to hear both fewer opinions of their fellow mock jurors, and more opinions that were consistent with their own opinion."
Bahns,Angela,abahns@wellesley.edu,jMAZY2XEaT,Similarity in Relationships as Niche Construction,"We sampled 1,523 relationship pairs to study the role of similarity as niche construction in friendships. Dyads were similar on 86% of attitudes, personality traits and behaviors measured. Similarity was not moderated by closeness, length, or discussion. Similarity did increase with importance of the attitude and (very modestly) with intimacy."

Researchers also explored feminist identification."
Baker,Melissa,mbaker25@ucmerced.edu,CG63CLRuap,Attributing Political Ideology to Biology Versus Choice Influences Attitudes About Political Outgroups,"Poster Board#: P261In an experimental design, researchers presented participants with information about a liberal or conservative whose ideology was attributed either to biology and genetics or to personal choice. Participants expressed less negativity about the outgroup after reading about a member of that group whose ideology had a biological basis."
Baker,Michael,michaeljamesbaker@csu.fullerton.edu,FgC0Sm7Q6x,"Touch, Trust and Performance in a Group Activity","Poster Board#: P147Touch can convey emotions and emphasize affiliation in small groups. Touch can communicate trust in any group task, therefore it is hypothesized that participants perform better in a group task when touched. Results show greater trust by students in the touch group."
Baker,Samuel,sgb4h8@mail.missouri.edu,bzUXrwHusK,Pick Your Emotional Poison: Lay Theories About Emotional Influence on Judgments,"Poster Board#: P065How do people believe their emotions will influence their judgments? Participants chose either an anger or sadness emotion induction before making sadness-related judgments (helping the poor) or anger-related judgments (guilt for serious crimes). Participants preferred the emotion induction matching the task, indicating judgment-relevant emotions were believed to produce less bias."
Baker,Zachary,zbaker@uh.edu,D6u93lg2uF,Autonomy is Sexy: The Benefits of Autonomous Representations in Relationship Initiation,"Poster Board#: E053The present research (N = 329) manipulated self-determination (i.e., autonomy) in the context of personal dating advertisements. Findings suggest that more autonomous personal advertisements were perceived as more attractive to single, potential dating partners. These results held when controlling for emotions associated with advertisements as well as rater-reported, personality-level autonomy."
Balcetis,Emily,eb107@nyu.edu,Tz3IGKIoTW,Putting the I in Victim: Concern for the Self Moderates Just-World Beliefs in Victim Blame,"Poster Board#: I231We suggest that just-world beliefs, thought to explain victim blame, do not sufficiently or reliably predict blame. Three studies involving victims of assault and disaster find that the interaction of just-world beliefs and concern for the self is necessary to produce blame though a mechanism of invoked personal threat."

Barchard,Kimberly,kim.barchard@unlv.edu,mLw7yWfq34,Null Hypothesis Significance Testing is Prejudiced,"Poster Board#: E263Null hypothesis significance testing can identify differences between groups, but is mathematically incapable of demonstrating similarities. Thus, it encourages stereotyping, ingroup favoritism and hate crimes. To demonstrate that groups are similar to each other, researchers should instead present confidence intervals for differences that are narrow and close to zero."
Baren,Alison,alisonbaren@gmail.com,PLpgbzrpSQ,"Attachment Style, Empathy and Schadenfreude: How Close Relationships Influence Reactions Toward Others in Need","Poster Board#: I033We investigated the role of individual differences on empathy, distress and schadenfreude toward advantaged and disadvantaged targets. Participants reported more distress (especially anxious people), more empathy and less schadenfreude toward suffering, disadvantaged others. We also developed and validated a new scale of trait schadenfreude, as no such scale currently exists."

Gibbons,Aaliyah,Gibbonas@clarkson.edu,fcKq7GiLxS,Lacking vs. Wanting Social Support: Their Unique Roles in Mediating the Link between Peer Victimization and Health,"Poster Board#: I001Peer victimization is associated with myriad of negative mental and physical health outcomes. However, little is known about how being bullied affects the way people process information. Our findings provide evidence that this association is accounted for by both the need to belong and thwarting of relatedness needs."
Gibson,Carolyn,cegibson504@gmail.com,L24iHBp2Mz,Conditional Empathy: Empathy for Rejected Others Based on Race and Experience,"Poster Board#: H006How does being rejected influence empathy for others who have had the same experience? Empathy research suggests that shared experience promotes empathy, whereas rejection research suggests an emotional numbness that disrupts empathy. The current results suggest that the effect of rejection on empathy depends on similarity with the target."

Jaff,Mariela,mariela.jaffe@unibas.ch,ObRvEZX1Xv,Sad is True in the Here And Now: How Psychological Distance Moderates the Negativity Bias in Judgments of Truth,"Poster Board#: H204The negativity bias holds that the same messages are more frequently deemed true if framed negatively than positively. Here we investigate the interplay between the negativity bias and psychological distance. Consistent with Construal Level Theory, the negativity bias is observed in conditions of psychological proximity but not distance."
Jger,Andreas,andreas.jaeger@mx.uni-saarland.de,8FNLThT0UW,Using Self-Regulation to Overcome the Effects of Low Power in Negotiations,Poster Board#: A275Low power leads to poor outcomes in negotiations. This research shows that making if-then plans helps to overcome these detrimental effects. Low power negotiators who had formed if-then plans reached higher individual gains and conceded less than low power negotiators without self-regulatory aid in both face-to-face- and computer-mediated negotiations.
Jago,Arthur,ajago@stanford.edu,JHmzN25NK9,Corporate Moral Reasoning: Do People Believe Organizations Subscribe to Moral Duties?,"Poster Board#: I199Across four studies, we investigate how people respond to organizations' moral justifications. Because people believe organizations cannot experience emotions, they also believe that they, compared to other entities, cannot reason deontologically, but can reason consequentially. The way organizations justify their decisions can ultimately influence people's opinions of them."
James,Nicole,nicole.james@yorkmail.cuny.edu,F6Xc13bFz7,Narcissism and Inter-Religious Hostility,"Poster Board#: H293Both individual narcissism and collective religious narcissism are positively independently related to inter-religious hostility, with religious narcissism explaining more of the variance.  However, when controlling for demographics and other commonly-used personality measures suggestive of religious narcissism (authoritarianism, exclusivity, fundamentalism, dogmatism), only individual narcissism remained as a significant independent predictor."
Jamieson,Jeremy,jamieson.jp@gmail.com,Iaqm3dWgtk,When Good News is Bad News: Physiological Consequences of Capitalizing with a Restrictive Partner,"Poster Board#: E003Romantic couples engaged in a hypothetical discussion wherein one person, the discloser, revealed he/she had just gotten into his/her dream job or school. Disclosers with partners high (vs. low) in restrictiveness were physiologically threatened, found the conversation cognitively demanding, engaged in more emotional suppression, and thought partners were less constructive."

Jia,Lile,psyjl@nus.edu.sg,xyt2naaLla,Facing Death Together: Engaging in Mortality Salience with Others Buffers Death Anxiety,"Poster Board#: H152Participants that considered their mortality alone showed higher Self-Esteem Striving to defend against death anxiety. However, when they perceived themselves as a group considering mortality together, this effect disappeared. Meanwhile, these participants also exhibited higher Implicit Self-Esteem. These results suggest that group affiliation pre-emptively buffers death anxiety."
Jiang,Tao,tao.jiang09@gmail.com,KchKjvjp3J,The Association Between Compassionate Goals and Self-Regulation,"Poster Board#: A299The current study examined the relationship between compassionate goals and self-regulation. The results showed that compassionate goals predicted less self-regulation failure for students who had high self-regulatory demands, which suggests that being constructive and supportive toward others may facilitate one's self-regulation when his/her energy resource is low."
Ji,Li-jun,lijunji@queensu.ca,UsvID5Ct0J,Cross-Cultural Preferences for Offensive and Defensive Strategies,"Poster Board#: E079We examined 350 Euro-Canadians and 419 Chinese on their preferences for offensive and defensive strategies, and found that, contrary to our predictions (based on dialecticism and regulatory focus), Chinese preferred offensive strategies more than Canadians, and Canadians preferred defensive strategies more than Chinese. We will discuss potential reasons."
Ji,Li-Jun,lijunji@queensu.ca,VnWUC5sF1Z,Vicarious Power,Poster Board#: I258Two studies demonstrated that people can gain power vicariously from figures with which they are psychologically.

Objects in stereotype-congruent trials (Black-Gun, White-Nongun) provide more evidence per unit of time in the evidence accumulation process, yielding the race X object interactions for error rates and RTs."
Johnson,Elizabeth,ejohnso1@skidmore.edu,mebLtgFuIn,Backlash Against Male Elementary Educators,"Poster Board#: A327We investigated the existence and processes underscoring backlash against male elementary school educators. As expected, male applicants encountered backlash (i.e., were rated as more likely to be gay, less likeable, and more threatening than identical female applicants). Perceived sexuality mediated this backlash, which was unaffected by behavioral attributions."
Johnson,India,ijohnson5@elon.edu,8yKKpirklM,Evaluative Discrepancies in Depression and Information Search,"Poster Board#: P016Previous work suggests discrepancies between implicit and explicit attitudes produce greater information processing of messages relevant to the discrepancy. Examining depression attitudes, the present work investigates if evaluative discrepancies also predict discrepancy-relevant information search. Results revealed as implicit-explicit discrepancy increased, participants were more likely to seek discrepancy-related (vs. discrepancy-unrelated) information."
Johnson,Kate,kate.johnson@usc.edu,A7V2u5rktC,With Us or Against Them: Identity as a Lens Through Which Moral Values Motivate Action,Poster Board#: I215Morality serves an important social function by binding individuals together into communities of shared values. We provide evidence that individual-level moral beliefs are related to internalized identities as well as identification with domain-specific social groups. Group identification helps to explain engagementand disengagementin group-endorsed moral behavior and intergroup conflict.
Johnson,Kirsten,kira.elainej@gmail.com,RWuSH81reA,Concern for Others Leads to Successful Conflict Resolution,"Poster Board#: P126Two studies considered whether traits relating to having feelings of concern for, or taking an interest in, the thoughts and emotions of others are positively associated with adopting positive conflict behaviors, and with successful resolution. Agreeableness was the strongest predictor of adopting positive conflict behaviors and with achieving optimal resolution."
Johnson,Melissa,majohn@iastate.edu,xWpTu7ClUP,"The Newsfeed Blues: Loneliness, Mood and Social Observation on Facebook","Poster Board#: I074A daily diary study of Facebook activity examined the effect of social observation of friends and ones romantic partner via Facebook on loneliness and mood.

Findings suggest relational context moderates the effects of inflammation on perceptions of closeness within a romantic relationship."
Keefer,Lucas,lkeefer1@udayton.edu,xMwEXJnuAe,Frighteningly Similar: Relationship Metaphors Elicit Defensive Information Processing,"Poster Board#: H171Prior research shows that individuals who are more avoidantly attached, defensively avoid information about close relationships. In two studies, we tested whether relationship (vs. alternative) metaphors would elicit this tendency toward otherwise non-threatening targets. We found that both dispositional and situational attachment avoidance decreased recall of relationship-metaphoric information."
Keeney,Jonathan,jek@unc.edu,tLPgMOxbLN,The Profit Paradox: Immoral Profit Flows from Virtuous Premises,"Poster Board#: L145People generally endorse the Protestant work-ethic (hard work is virtuous) and the equity principle (outputs should match inputs), so does it follow that money-making is virtuous? Six studies reveal that profit is perceived to signal immorality. Surprisingly, this effect disappears only when profits premises (hard work, fair pay) are violated."
Keesman,Mike,m.keesman@uu.nl,xpl3XGTS2s,A Brief Mindfulness Training Prevents Negative Affect and Food Craving,"Poster Board#: A292How does mindfulness work to increase wellbeing? In three experiments, researchers trained participants to adopt the perspective that thoughts are transient mental events (decentering). This prevented negative affect and food craving in response to unpleasant memories and tempting snacks, suggesting that decentering is a crucial component for mindfulness effects."
Kelley,John,johnwilsonkelley@gmail.com,nriJxlUo7I,Professors with Higher Grandiose Narcissism Scores are More Likely to Believe That Others Find Them Helpful,"Poster Board#: I247Narcissists are infamous for their selfish, antisocial behavior, but in some contexts, their path to self-glorification may require projecting helpfulness. Consistent with this possibility, our study found that professors at an undergraduate-focused college who were relatively narcissistic were more likely to believe that students viewed them as helpful."
Kelly,Adea,lsloan@howard.edu,TcNVmFAwdG,White Ostracism Reduces African-Americans Reconnection Desires: Non-Prejudice Reassurances Eliminate Those Race Effects.,"Poster Board#: H010Researchers assured (or not) African-Americans of co-players non-prejudice, then were ostracized/included by Black or White co-players. Ostracism decreased reconnection to White ostracizers (not Blacks), while non-prejudice reassurances restored reconnection desires, eliminating race impacts. This suggests bracing for loss and/or differing anticipatory construals based on ostracizer/includer race, which may moderate ostracisms impacts."

In two studies findings with 7  10-year-olds (N = 302) and 9 - 14-year-olds (N =204) revealed racial bias as a function of the age and race of the participant, and the composition and context of peer encounter."
Kim,Boyoung,Boyoung_Kim_1@brown.edu,4yTa67cpf5,Disentangling the Badness and Illegality of Transgressions in Everyday Moral Criticism,"Poster Board#: L135Intense interpersonal acts of blame are judged as more appropriate as the badness of moral transgressions increases. However, we found that this tendency is weaker for illegal transgressions than for non-illegal transgressions. These findings suggest that disentangling badness and illegality is necessary for understanding the psychology of everyday morality."
KIM,Dasom,somvlee@gmail.com,tAh589VBmE,Psychological Consequences of Sexual Objectification,"Poster Board#: H108We tested whether being objectified by others would lead to self-objectification.

Results show that identity motives satisfaction are crucial for couple identity."
Manzi,Francesca,fm908@nyu.edu,958nktyTUI,Trailblazers or Trailblockers? The Effect of Female Leaders on Evaluations of Other Women,"Poster Board#: H109In three studies, we provide evidence that gender salience, stemming from the atypicality of women in male-typed leadership positions, leads to a generalization from the performance of female leaders to expectations of success for female candidates. Our results suggest that exposure to female leaders is not unequivocally positive."

March,David,dmarch@vols.utk.edu,iQlOQbWi6f,"Threat, Not Negativity, Drives Attention: An Initial Test of the Dual Implicit Processes (DIP) Model","Poster Board#: A-Winner002We extend dual-process models by distinguishing between two implicit processes. Implicit 1 reflexively responds to immediate physical threat and precedes Implicit 2, which responds to the full negative-to-positive continuum. Consistent with the DIP model, persons more quickly detected negative-threatening than negative-non-threatening images. Thus, threat processing precedes other evaluative processes."
Marelich,William,wmarelich@gmail.com,oUcerWwU3x,Development of a Measure of Sexual Regrets: The Sexual Regret Scale,"Poster Board#: E051Researchers developed a 10-item scale to assess regrets after casual sexual encounters, the Sexual Regret Scale. Two subscales emerged (Emotional and Self-Judgment Regret) with good psychometrics.

McGuinness,Patrick,psmcgu15@g.holycross.edu,U1SGwBuLNS,Self-Sympathetic Learning in Emotion Recognition Training,Poster Board#: L124This pilot study investigated whether a new emotion recognition training program could produce higher improvement rates in micro-expression recognition than standard training methods alone. Findings are encouraging and suggest that further studies of the self-sympathetic learning method be taken beyond healthy participants to populations with emotion recognition deficits.
McIntyre,Kevin P.,kmcintyr@trinity.edu,6CdtmUtwPa,How Do Close Relationships Change the Self-Concept?: A Two-Dimensional Model,"Poster Board#: I065Individuals in close relationships perceive self-concept changes across four distinct processes: self-expansion (gain positive traits), self-adulteration (gain negative traits), self-contraction (lose positive traits) and self-pruning (lose negative traits). Across two studies, these self-processes predicted a variety of positive (e.g., commitment, accommodation) and negative (e.g., dissolution, revenge) relational variables."
McIntyre,Miranda,mm@purdue.edu,ugwoQW4JuL,Individual Differences in Viewing People and Things: Evidence for Selective Attention Processes,"Poster Board#: H174Individuals are differentially interested in their social and physical environments, but little is known about how cognitive processes relate to these variations. The current study demonstrated that individuals attend selectively to interest-congruent image content. These findings provide evidence supporting the theoretical claims and construct validity of Person and Thing Orientations."
McKimmie,Blake,b.mckimmie@psy.uq.edu.au,wsuVXGCnqT,The Dual Effect of Jury Instruction Simplification,"Poster Board#: E205Three studies examined the dual effect of jury instruction simplification. While simplification enhanced mock jurors application of the instructions to decide a verdict, it also led mock jurors to choose to hear both fewer opinions of their fellow mock jurors, and more opinions that were consistent with their own opinion."
McKissick,Kayla,kaylamckissick@yahoo.com,FnDZsuyDct,The Effects of Timeouts Psychological Momentum,Poster Board#: L013We examined archived play-by-plays of 650 volleyball matches to determine if timeouts can diminish psychological momentum in sports competitions. We compared the rate of scoring a point after a timeout to the rate of scoring a point during typical play. We found that timeouts have no effect on psychological momentum.

McLemore,Kevin,kamclemore@ucdavis.edu,bGtdNy16bU,Reactions to Disclosure of Sexual Orientation,"Poster Board#: E323We tested how valence and extremity of reactions to a sexual orientation disclosure influence perceptions of those reactions. Both heterosexual and sexual minority participants perceived positive reactions more favorably than negative reactions. Sexual minorities perceived mildly positive reactions more favorably than extremely positive reactions, whereas heterosexual participants perceived the reverse."
McLernon,Heather,mclernon.heather@gmail.com,KNnfdSA3k1,The Differential Impact of Angry Rumination and Schizotypal Personality Disorder on Violent and Non-Violent Crime,"Poster Board#: A054Schizotypal symptoms (SS) moderated the impact of angry rumination (AR) on crime. AR is positively related to violent and non-violent crime for those low and average in SS. For those high in SS, AR did not significantly impact violent crime, whereas AR marginally decreased non-violent crime."
McMahon,Jean,mcmah@pdx.edu,4ywKpNkdpf,Feeling Unsafe and Endorsing Racial Violence: The Mediating Roles of Protective Paternalism and Trust in Police,"Poster Board#: A333We examined links between womens perceptions of safety, protective paternalism and attitudes about police. Women who felt less safe endorsed more protective paternalism, which related directly and indirectly to support for police violence against racial minorities. Support for excessive force against minorities may be another insidious consequence of benevolent sexism."

However, hormonal contractive (HC) use may interrupt this process. Indeed, husbands perceived commitment was negatively associated with jealousy among husbands whose wives were not using HCs, but unassociated among husbands with wives who were using HCs."
Mendez Sawers,Alicia,amsawers@uw.edu,lcSRAcx8PG,What Does Independence Look Like for First-Generation College Students?,"Poster Board#: H029First-generation college students (FGs) experience of independence may differ from continuing-generation students. 500 participants described thoughts of new experiences in college. Findings suggest independence may occur later in college for FGs, and it may be tied more to leaving ones family than to discovering oneself or making ones own decisions."
Mercier,Brett,mercierbrett0@gmail.com,P4HjH3P0bV,The Relationship Between Beliefs About Human Nature and Support for Personal Liberty,"Poster Board#: P246Beliefs about human nature may provide a foundation for larger worldviews like political ideology. In an MTurk sample (n = 459), we find that belief that human nature is inherently good (vs. evil) correlates with greater support for economic conservatism and personal liberty, but is unrelated to social attitudes."

Meyers,Chanel,ckmeyers@hawaii.edu,5cmJ0Sak34,Can I Say That?: How Social Context Influences Colorblind Strategies,"Poster Board#: P087In two studies, we examined whether adults in a racially-diverse environment would exhibit strategic colorblindness. Contrary to past research, both White and non-White adults did not adopt a colorblind strategy. This social context may influence how people think about and utilize race, which allow them to freely mention race."
Meyers,Sal,sal.meyers@simpson.edu,KDWCF1kQB2,Self-Regulation and Implicit Theories of Writing Ability and Willpower: The Importance of the Amount of Revision Needed,Poster Board#: A278This study found that students reactions to feedback on a paper draft depend on both students implicit theories and the extent to which the paper needs substantial revision. Whether implicit theories of ability or willpower are most relevant depends on whether the paper is pretty good or requires substantial revision.
Michaels,Jay,jmichaels@presby.edu,FjXMhzzXoc,How or Why do We Disagree?: People React Differently to Disagreement Depending on Action Identification Tendency,"Poster Board#: P020We examined whether reaction to disagreement varies depending on peoples baseline action identity style. Participants exhibited significant attitude reaction regardless of identity style. However, those with higher level identities did not exhibit emotional reaction while those with lower level identities did. Thus, low level agents may be more socially influenced."

Miller,Stuart,ssmiller@ksu.edu,C58TwGVTyA,Swords and Shields: Using Racial Humor to Confront Prejudice,"Poster Board#: I242We examined racial humors potential to confront prejudice. Disparaging humor was interpreted as disparaging, loosening norms of prejudice expression. Ironically, humor intended as confrontational was frequently interpreted as disparaging. When interpreted as confrontational, participants perceived it as more anti-racist. These interpretations were moderated by individuals propensities to make prejudiced attributions."

Netzer,Liat,Liat.netzer@mail.huji.ac.il,1I6yeYUEOz,Interpersonal Instrumental Emotion Regulation,"Poster Board#: I104Interpersonal instrumental emotion regulation occurs when people try to influence others emotions to attain personal goals. In three studies, we show that people try to make others feel anger and fear to attain personal (Study 1) and group (Studies 2-3) goals."
Neufeld,Katelin,umneu275@myumanitoba.ca,jhBsT8flTo,Abstract Construals Increase Public Support for Addressing Local Injustice,"Poster Board#: P298When will people support local social change? We provide experimental evidence that construal level (Liberman & Trope, 1998) is one factor that impacts justice decisions. We manipulated construal level and found abstract thinking increased support for addressing local injustice because it increased empathy and moral outrage and decreased feasibility concerns."
Newberg,Amy,anewberg10@gmail.com,i1ZD6ziPqy,My Way or the Highway: Attachment as a Predictor of Relationship Influence,"Poster Board#: L038People of differing attachment styles may utilize various strategies when trying to influence their partner. Insecure attachment was associated with increased use of indirect, unilateral influence tactics. Avoidant individuals additionally reported less influence on their romantic partners. These findings underscore the importance of attachment in understanding influence within romantic relationships."
Newbold,Jacqueline,jackie11@uga.edu,1vad7sVjKh,Investigating Moderators of Using the Self as a Reference for Behavior,"Poster Board#: E071Two studies explored the relationship between internal dispositions and disposition-related behaviors. Researechers found a stronger disposition-behavior relationship for participants in an ancestral (v. modern) mindset when measuring a heritable trait (Study 1), but there was no effect of mindset on the disposition-behavior relationship using a low heritability trait (Study 2)."
Newell,Ellen,ellen.newell@wilkes.edu,q6hfo2tOX7,Ill Show You My Town is Not Miserable!: Endorsement of the Protestant Work Ethic Moderates Identification with Devalued Communities,"Poster Board#: L260Protestant work ethic (PWE) suggests people have a responsibility to work hard and this effort can improve social status. Across two studies, we show that PWE appears to motivate individuals to identify with, commit to living in and improve devalued geographic communities, but only when devalued community membership is made salient."
Newman,Leonard,lsnewman@syr.edu,q4vIU6bSEb,The Moderating Effect of Attachment Styles in Peoples Preference for Relational or Non-Relational Self-Expansion,"Poster Board#: H169This study examines whether attachment styles moderate peoples preferences for relational or non-relational routes to self-expansion (operationalized in two ways). Researchers found that anxiety was not a significant moderator, yet avoidance positively correlated with preferences for non-relational self-expansion, as well as the residual preference for relational over non-relational expansion."
Ng,Ben,benngkl86@gmail.com,qXhrnhgT2Q,Religious Differences in Moral Perception of Others,"Poster Board#: H288Research on moral judgments in the context of the trolley problem generally found that people are less willing to intentionally cause direct bodily harm, even if it means saving more lives. However, we hypothesize that the religious are more inclined to judge deontological acts as more moral than utilitarian acts, but the nonreligious will display opposite effects."
Ng,Brandon,brandonng2011@u.northwestern.edu,G3ByQP5tin,The Cognitive Consequences of Moving: The Effects of a Residentially Mobile Mindset on Self-Control and the Neurophysiological Response to Errors,"Poster Board#: A277Residential mobility induces anxiety, loneliness and stress. These variables have each been linked to self-control, but research has not explored the relationship between residential mobility and self-control. In two studies, we found that a mobile mindset heightens self-regulation and the neurophysiological response to error monitoring (the error-related negativity)."
Ng,Chi Kit,jckng@psy.cuhk.edu.hk,RkT5lGoDFc,The Effect of Social Exclusion on Prosocial and Antisocial Tendencies: A Meta-analysis,"Poster Board#: I007Some studies show that social exclusion increases prosocial intentions, whereas other studies show that social exclusion increases antisocial intentions. This meta-analysis examines how between-study variations of situational variables (e.g. type of rejection, relative behavioral cost of reconnection versus aggression, relationship value) can explain these effects of social exclusion."
Ng,Henry,henryksng@hku.hk,ScDH4Iod27,Social Inclusion Counteracts the Ego Depletion Effect,"Poster Board#: L054Social exclusion has been reported to deplete self-control performance, but little is known about the effect of social inclusion. This paper presents four studies showing that social inclusion does not enhance self-control in a nondepleted status, but it does recover self-control after prior ego depletion."
Ng,Michael,mictim0415@gmail.com,ZRJBRm54Zq,Relationship Between Levels of Resilience and Physiological and Psychological Stress Response,"Poster Board#: P201Can resilience, a personality factor describing how quickly individuals bounce back from stressors, predict physiological response to an acute laboratory stressor? Results demonstrate that high levels of resilience interact with pharmacological manipulation (propranolol and dexamethasone) to produce a dampened stress response to a public speaking and mental math challenge."

Wenwen,wenwenni23@ucla.edu,8n3YMllEc9,Negative Feedback from Male Supervisors Discourages Women from Pursuing Leadership Roles,Poster Board#: E123One cause of womens underrepresentation in leadership roles may be the gender of their workplace supervisor. Women who received negative feedback from male supervisors (vs. female supervisors) were more likely to attribute the feedback to gender stereotypes and had less desire for leadership roles.
Niiya,Yu,yniiya@gmail.com,YjqviInBnq,Wanting to Be Kind Vs. Wanting to Appear Kind: Self-Image and Compassionate Goals in Japan,"Poster Board#: L200We developed a scale specifically for Japan to measure compassionate goals to support the wellbeing of others, and self-image goals to promote one's desired self-image. Self-image goals correlated exclusively with interdependence, whereas compassionate goals correlated exclusively with independence, suggesting that Japanese interdependence may reflect an egoistic rather than altruistic motive."

Participants completed stress, diet, and health questionnaires. Multiple regression analysis revealed healthy diet fully mediates the relationship between stress and health ( = .04; CI = .0097 to .1006)."
Ungson,Nick,ndu213@lehigh.edu,5g474PmCUx,The Complexity of Loyalty Conceptions and their Relation to Whistleblowing,"Poster Board#: H144We explored lay conceptions of group loyalty and their relationship to whistleblowing regarding ingroup transgressions. We identified multiple distinct loyalty construals, and found that some construals (loyalty as ingroup preference, loyalty as conformity) consistently negatively predicted willingness to whistleblow, whereas others (loyalty as dependability/integrity) positively predicted whistleblowing under specific conditions."
Unkelbach,Christian,christian.unkelbach@uni-koeln.de,G48pKwRY75,The Common Good in Person Perception: An Amplification/Attenuation Model of Social Comparison,"Poster Board#: P167We present an amplification/attenuation model for comparative person perception, predicting that shared attributes are more positive than unshared attributes. The social world bears a positivity prevalence, and searching for similarities among other people amplifies, while searching for differences attenuates this prevalence. We present a simulation and data from five experiments."
Urban,Emily,eurban@uci.edu,2hpifDd2kb,Feeling Blue and Seeing Red: The Prevalence of Anger Among Adults with a History of Depression,"Poster Board#: P046The experience of anger in depression has largely been ignored. Our daily-diary study found that people with a depression history experienced more daily anger than sadness or anxiety. Furthermore, anger, more so than anxiety or sadness, distinguished the daily emotional lives of people with a depression history from those without."
Uysal,Ahmet,uahmet@metu.edu.tr,6XhB7PAWRb,Spousal Autonomy Support and Well-Being of Individuals with Chronic Pain: A Dyadic Longitudinal Study,Poster Board#: I029We examined the association between spousal autonomy support and psychological well-being of individuals with chronic pain (ICPs). We collected dyadic longitudinal data from 130 ICPs and their spouses. Perceived spousal autonomy support predicted higher well-being of ICPs and partner-reported autonomy support moderated this association.
Uzarevic,Filip,filip.uzarevic@uclouvain.be,PTBsq7RIUg,Awes Effects on Existential and Scientific Beliefs of Non-Believers,"Poster Board#: L107Awe increases spirituality, more clearly among believers, but what are its effects among non-believers? In an online experiment, induction of awe, compared to a neutral condition, made non-religious participants more highly accept mystery (inexplicability) in the world, and, those additionally open to experience, to believe less in science."
Uz,Irem,iremuz@gmail.com,iON1QQ2DJ4,Cultural Tightness and Looseness Measures Cross-Validated,Poster Board#: H041Between-country and within-country measures of cultural tightness and looseness were cross-validated. They correlated highly with each other at the U.S. divisional level (r =.92) and with theoretical variables of interest. Convergence of results with measures computed via maximally different methods increases confidence in the validity of these two CTL measures.
Vaccarino,Elysia,elysia.vac@gmail.com,HklWcIJYma,Limits and Consequences of Colorblind Strategies,"Poster Board#: E307In a study demonstrating the potential adverse affects of colorblind strategies, results supported the prevalence of these strategies and demonstrated that, for participants high in implicit prejudice, the colorblind strategy led to increased explicit prejudice, whereas for those low in implicit prejudice, explicit bias did not increase."
Vail III,Kenneth,vail.kenneth@gmail.com,iCyOrb24wA,Exploring the Unique Function of Religion in Offering Meaning in the Face of Death,"Poster Board#: H296According to terror management theory, religious individuals and atheists may have unique responses to dealing with concerns about death. Following reminders of death, atheists showed decreased meaning in life while Christians levels of meaning were unaffected. Religious beliefs may help individuals maintain meaning in the face of mortality reminders."
Vail,Kenneth,vail.kenneth@gmail.com,2SVzfWcZfM,"The Impact of Mortality Awareness on Ideological Dogmatism, Religious Belief and Need for Cognition Among Religious and Non-Religious Individuals","Poster Board#: H294Three studies showed that 1) mortality salience increased dogmatism among Christians and Muslims but reduced it among atheists; 2) this effect was mediated by respective shifts in support of, or rejection of, religious worldview content; and 3) that MS reduced need for cognition among Christians, but increased it among atheists."
Valenti,Jennifer,valenti8@buffalo.edu,wbGvIymduN,"Think, Pray, Decide: The Effects of Prayer on Decision Making","Poster Board#: H290Research examined the influence of prayer on intuitive and deliberative thinking. Researchers proposed that prayer would lead individuals to engage in more intuitive thinking, but not at the cost of deliberative thinking. Additionally, they examined situational self-awareness as a potential mechanism for these effects. Results provided support for these hypotheses."
Valsesia,Francesca,valsesia@usc.edu,ZCv1EkOgL5,Brand Name Fluency and Product Choice: A Conformity Account,"Poster Board#: E176Across three studies, we find that products with fluently processed brand names are perceived as more popular. Hence, products with fluent brand names are more likely to be chosen when consumers want to fit in rather than stand out, independent of whether that motive is manipulated or chronic."
Valshtein,Timothy,valstj14@wfu.edu,ycXqYjsYYX,"Regret for Some, Regret for All: Individual Differences, Outcome Severity and Feelings of Regret",Poster Board#: L197Two studies investigated the relationship between traits of conscientiousness and negative consequences following failure to meet achievement-related goals on feelings of regret. Results demonstrated that regret was significantly affected by personality factors related to conscientiousness and the severity of the outcomes that followed failure to meet goals.
Van Bavel,Jay,jay.vanbavel@nyu.edu,pxDE1xqWzp,Costly Punishment and Leadership in Young Children,"Poster Board#: I203Group-based origins of human evolution suggest that individuals will be particularly motivated to ensure the cooperative behavior of group members. This study shows this prediction to be true, even at personal cost, and among children as young as four."
Van Boven,Leaf,vanboven@colorado.edu,8lCnsxLHKx,From Mindless to Attentive Choice: Introspection Increases Belief-Decision Correspondence by Calling Attention to Important Decision Criteria,"Poster Board#: A175People often make mindless decisions, especially when unimportant information attracts attention. We demonstrate that introspecting about how to make decisions increases the extent to which people use and attend to criteria they believe are most important. Introspection decreases reliance on salient information and aligns decisions with prescriptive beliefs."
van Breen,Jolien,j.a.van.breen@rug.nl,l7ivPZjmD7,Responses to Implicit Counter-Stereotypes,"Poster Board#: L318This poster focuses on responses to counter-stereotypes that occur at the implicit level, and the role played by identity processes. We exposed women to implicit counter-stereotypes and found that implicit counter-stereotypes elicit motivated responses; traditionally identified women showed backlash effects against their in-group on the Moral Choice Dilemma task."
Van Camp,Amanda,amandarosevancamp@gmail.com,K3quIF1Mdm,The Effect of Value Violations on Prejudice Toward Muslims,"Poster Board#: A316In Study 1, participants perceived Muslims as less supportive of gender equality than Christians. Furthermore, perceptions of Muslims support for gender equality were correlated with Islamophobia. In Study 2, increasing perceptions of Muslims support for gender equality decreased Islamophobia. This research suggests value violation may help explain prejudice toward Muslims."
Van Cappellen,Patty,pattyv@live.unc.edu,AsTk2PBx2e,"Good Day for Leos: Horoscopes Influence on Perception, Cognitive Performances and Creativity","Poster Board#: I256Is reading ones horoscope without consequences? In three experiments, researchers found reading a positive versus negative personal horoscope to increase positive interpretation of ambiguous events, cognitive performance and creativity. Horoscopes are more than mere entertainment, but influence peoples perceptions and cognitive performances."
Van Damme,Carolien,carolien.vandamme@ppw.kuleuven.be,kg7wgyxL0c,Observers Dislike Explicit Self-Superiority Claims from In-Group but Not from Out-Group Members,"Poster Board#: TBDObservers dislike explicit self-superiority claims (I am better than others) more when these refer to the observers group than to another group, because such claims suggest that the claimant views the observer negatively. Claimants are thus evaluated based on how they supposedly view the observer rather than themselves."
van der Linden,Meta,meta.vanderlinden@soc.kuleuven.be,yRb5DGOg9D,"Parenting Style, Parents' Attitudes and Family Climate as Determinants of Parent-Child Similarity in Prejudice Toward Immigrants","Poster Board#: L327What determines parent-child similarity with regard to prejudice toward immigrants? Relatively little is known about the formation of prejudice during adolescence. We examine the extent to which adolescents own experiences with immigrants, as well as their parents attitudes and family climate determine adolescents prejudice toward immigrants."
van der Wal,Reine,r.c.vanderwal@uu.nl,s0KSdwZQZ8,Value Priorities in Romantic Relationships,"Poster Board#: L081We propose that basic human values may play an important role in relationship processes that define a well-functioning relationship. The findings of this study suggest that the endorsement of self-enhancement vs. self-transcendence values is associated with less relationship satisfaction, and a more negative attitude toward forgiveness, fidelity and sacrifice."
Vanderzanden,Karen,karen.vanderzanden@my.und.edu,c1Q8k1Tw6W,A Structural Equation Model of Juror Sentencing Decisions in a Race-Based Hate Crime,"Poster Board#: E204Using structural equation modeling, we examined the direct and indirect relationship between racial prejudice and sentencing decisions in a race-based hate crime. Our SEM indicated that racial prejudice was a strong predictor of sentencing and that racial prejudice influenced attributions of blame toward the perpetrator, which in turn predicted sentencing."
Van Dessel,Pieter,Pieter.VanDessel@UGent.be,vuTKGOjrJ4,Changing Implicit Evaluations via Approach-Avoid Instructions,"Poster Board#: P169In line with the idea that implicit evaluations are mediated by propositional representations, we observed that instructions to approach or avoid stimuli can lead to changes in the implicit evaluations of those stimuli. Contrary to predictions by dual-process models, these effects were not mediated by changes in explicit evaluations."
Van Doesum,Niels,n.j.van.doesum@vu.nl,S2YIkFZnSz,Class Impressions: Higher Social Class Elicits Lower Prosociality,"Poster Board#: L241Researchers have found self social class to predict prosociality. But how prosocially do people treat others they perceive as coming from lower, middle or higher social classes? Across three studies, we find that participants behave less prosocially toward higher class interaction partners relative to lower, middle and class-wise unspecified partners."
Van Doren,Natalia,nataliavandoren@berkeley.edu,qU6mJb3vlV,Leaning In During Group Meetings: Do Women Prefer Low-Power Seats?,"Poster Board#: A229We tested Sandbergs hypothesis: women sit away from the table because they lack self-esteem. Participants ranked their seating preference. Women preferred high-power seats less, and high Self-Esteem predicted power-seat choices, but women were not lower in Self-Esteem. This study of college students provides partial support for the Lean-In hypothesis."
Van Enkevort,Erin,e.vanenkevort@tcu.edu,VJh9RkbeG5,Show Me the Money: The Influence of Money-related Metaphors on Financial Anxiety and Spending,Poster Board#: E192This research examined the effects of money-related metaphors. Results revealed that completing a finding a fortune word search (where the word fortune was found) attenuated money anxiety (Studies 1-3) and heightened consumer spending (Study 3) versus completing a searching for wealth metaphor (where the word wealth could not be found).
Van Lange,Paul,p.a.m.van.lange@vu.nl,GPEd3yv9Go,"Sometimes Cues of Being Watched Do Not Matter, but Individual Differences Do: The Role of Prosocial Personality Traits in Volunteer Behavior","Poster Board#: H183Empirical findings from two studies reignite the person-situation debate by suggesting that personality may account more than situational cues for variation in volunteer behavior. We showed that two prosocial personality traits, namely Social Value Orientation and Social Mindfulness, significantly affect volunteer behavior. Cues of being watched had no significant effect."
Van Loo,Katie,kvanloo@indiana.edu,ftGBYhOOxD,Feeling Powerful Decreases the Use of Base Rate Information in Probability Estimates,"Poster Board#: A173Having more of less power can drastically impact how one attends to and processes information. In one experiment (n=100), we investigated how power affects individuals tendency to neglect the base rate in making estimates, finding that the powerful are neglect base rate information significantly more than less powerful individuals."
van Monsjou,Elizabeth,vanmonsj@yorku.ca,zESPEBjVLL,Attachment and Apology,"Poster Board#: H162This study examined whether adult attachment styles would relate to how apologetic individuals are. Although attachment was an overall predictor, not all attachment styles affected likelihood of apologizing in the predicted ways. Secure individuals were actually less apologetic."
Vanood,Aimen,avanood@asu.edu,ZAeI95euev,The Military Personality Profile: Is it Conducive to Post-Service Success?,"Poster Board#: I271Previous research has shown that individuals joining the military are less agreeable and more neurotic than their civilian counterparts. Contrary to previous findings, we found no differences in these personality dimensions between student veterans and other college students. However, agreeableness influenced the academic progress of these groups differently."

However, people misperceive how they are viewed by others and thus fail to anticipate these consequences. We highlight various self-presentation strategies that inadvertently exacerbate these social costs.TALKS(full abstracts can be found in the document section below)Too Easy: When and Why Effortlessly Successful Others are DislikedHumblebragging: A Distinctand IneffectiveSelf-Presentation StrategyThe Perils of Positive Self-PresentationSome People Do All the Work: The Added Burdens of Successful Self-Regulators"
Van Tongeren,Daryl,vantongeren@hope.edu,7OPY0mp4De,Meaning and Prosocial Behavior,"Poster Board#: L174Meaning in life can arise from transcending the self. Thus, prosocial behavior may be related to meaning. Study 1 revealed a significant association between meaning and prosocial behavior. Study 2 provided longitudinal evidence that meaning predicts committing fewer future relational offenses. We discuss a reciprocal relationship between meaning and prosociality."

Vaughn,Leigh Ann,lvaughn@ithaca.edu,qzYS3nYCkz,Psychological Need Support and Regulatory Focus as Predictors of Self-Compassion,"Poster Board#: A156Three experiments suggest that need support in an activity can enhance self-compassion. Participants reported more need support in promotion-focused (vs. prevention-focused) activities. They also reported more self-compassion in more need-supportive activities. Support for relatedness and competence together predicted self-compassion in all studies, but self-esteem accounted for the effect of competence."
Vazeou-Nieuwenhuis,Anna,anv44@pitt.edu,WorLbRhfA9,The Meaning of Action: What Self-Regulatory Tendencies Produce a Purposeful Life?,"Poster Board#: E226Three studies (N=877) investigated potential sources of a sense of purpose in life and found that moving toward ones desired outcomes (locomotion self-regulatory mode) positively predicts a sense of purpose, while carefully comparing and selecting the best outcomes to pursue (assessment self-regulatory mode) negatively predicts a sense of purpose."

Zou,Linda,lxzou@uw.edu,norlJg5FLp,Foreignness and Inferiority: Evidence for a New Model of Racial Position,"Poster Board#: E155Three studies support a two-dimensional model of racial position, such that the four largest U.S. racial groups are located into four distinct quadrants as defined by their perceived unassimilable foreignness as well as perceived inferiority. This model effectively captures the distinct stereotypes and forms of prejudice that different groups face."
Zunick,Peter,Zunick.3@osu.edu,w56a0c71hE,Valence Weighting Tendencies and Self-Control,"Poster Board#: A295We examined the relation between individual differences in the weighting of positive versus negative valence. We assessed these differences via a performance-based measure of individuals attitude generalization tendencies, and self-control. These were operationalized both as responses on a self-report trait measure and as performance on a behavioral task that required exercising self-control."

Zvolensky,Michael,angie.s.leroy@gmail.com,Q9ezRGGzcS,"Anxiety Sensitivity Worsens the Painful Effects of Feeling Burdensome to Others: The Interplay Between Perceived Burdensomeness, Anxiety Sensitivity and Pain","Poster Board#: H004We found that those with high Anxiety Sensitivity (AS), specifically social concerns, felt greater social and physical pain after participating in a perceived burdensomeness manipulation. These findings suggest that AS may exacerbate the already painful effects of feeling burdensome to others, and may have important implications for pain-related interventions."
Zwolinski,Jennifer,jzwolinski@sandiego.edu,euxaFJ85A1,Experimental Social Support Benefits Mood for the Targets of Rejection but Not the Friends Who Provide the Support,"Poster Board#: I013Following rejection, undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of four levels of social support from a close friend to examine any mood benefit to the dyad. Direct support resulted in better mood outcomes than non-direct support for the target of rejection but not for the friend providing the support."
